About the Author

A Note to Readers
The skills described in the following pages are
called “deadly” for a
--- Page 5 ---
reason. Many were inspired by the missions and


--- Page 5 ---
training of Special Forces
personnel, operatives who are routinely pushed to the
limits of their
--- Page 5 ---
endurance, precision, and ingenuity under life-
threatening conditions. But
unlike the original 100 Deadly Skills, a manual
intended to expose civilians
to a shadowy special ops world filled with
subterfuge, surveillance, and
surreptitious infiltration, this survival edition is
geared toward actions that
will save lives—yours and those of the people around
you. The skills in this
book are meant to help you overcome a range of deadly
situations, from
getting lost at sea to being caught in the crosshairs
of an active shooter or
the tusks of a wild boar.
Still, some of these skills are extremely dangerous,
and many should
only be attempted in the direst of situations. All
require the application of
personal judgment, their necessity in any given
situation highly dependent
on context. A cricothyrotomy (see page 252) should be
performed by an
untrained bystander only in the event that a massive
trauma has mangled a
victim’s upper airway, less invasive attempts to
restore breathing have
failed, and an emergency dispatcher agrees that the
benefits outweigh the
risks. A botched attempt could result in spinal
injury or the laceration of a
major vessel or artery, eventualities for which even
the most well-meaning
bystander might be liable. Starting a signaling fire


--- Page 6 ---
with a cell phone battery
(see page 68) should only be undertaken in extreme
--- Page 6 ---
situations. And
--- Page 6 ---
attempting to thwart a pirate attack (see page 102)
or take out a hijacker
(see page 174) is a brave act of intervention with an
extremely high level of
risk.
The author and publisher disclaim any liability from
any injury that
may result from the use, proper or improper, of the
information contained
in this book. The stated goal of the book is not to
enable deadly actions
--- Page 11 ---
but to entertain while simultaneously imparting a
body of knowledge that
may come in handy in the absolute direst of
emergencies.
Be deadly in spirit, but not in action. Respect the
rights of others and
the laws of the land. May the strongest survive.

INTRODUCTION
The state of survival isn’t what it used to be.
Scroll back several hundred
years, and the living was harder, but the environment
was a known
quantity. Though our ancestors could still be felled
by illness, natural
disaster, or marauding troops, they knew the lay of
their land. They
probably hadn’t roamed far, from birth through old


--- Page 7 ---
--- Page 7 ---
age, but they
understood the risks they faced, and prepared for
those they could control.
Too often these days we’re lulled into a false sense
--- Page 7 ---
of security, an easy
complacency born of a matrix of assumptions about the
modern world.
The trains run on time (or are predictably delayed),
we hit the brakes at
red lights, we plan adventure treks and travel freely
around the globe. If
anything goes wrong, we reach for the tiny computers
in our pockets and
find the answer we’re looking for or summon the help
we need. But the
same conveniences that make our lives run so smoothly
—the top-of-the-
line gear that is meant to make outdoor exploration
even cushier, the cars
that whisk us to our offices, the computers that
research our queries and
crunch our complex algorithms, the planes that vault
us thousands of feet
through the air toward our final destinations—render
us soft on survival
skills and vulnerable to predators.
With a change of perspective, our modern conveniences
start to look a
lot like security loopholes.
Perhaps worst of all, their convenience is a double-
edged sword. Our
reliance on automated, networked, “smart” devices and
machines has also
made us more dependent, less smart—unable to find our
way around our
own cities without the aid of pinging cellular towers


--- Page 8 ---
or satellites tracking
our positioning from outer space, much less make our
way around in
unfamiliar territory.
--- Page 8 ---
If a catastrophic event occurs, will you have amassed
--- Page 8 ---
the knowledge and
undertaken the preparations necessary to survive?
What does survival look
like in a time when borders are porous and threats
are varied, ever-
changing, and sometimes unknowable? An increasingly
global, networked
society demands a new prototype for survival. A
blueprint that brings us
--- Page 14 ---
back to a core arsenal of lost skills, teaching us
how to navigate a
landscape devoid of street signs or satellite signals
while preparing us for
the newest and most up-to-date threats emerging in
our urban
environments—from lightning-fast pandemics to social
media–enabled
kidnapping scams.
A new blueprint for survival understands that the
line between war and
peace can be fractured in an instant, not by a
marauding horde but by a
lone actor carrying out the delusional fantasies of a
self-proclaimed world
order. This blueprint understands that in order to
survive such an attack,
each and every citizen must be prepared to fight. And
it also understands
that though the natural world around us sometimes
seems to have been


--- Page 9 ---
tamed, Mother Nature still has the power to surprise
and shock.
Take it from a retired Navy SEAL with twenty years of
special ops
service and extensive experience in identifying and
fortifying security
--- Page 9 ---
--- Page 9 ---
loopholes: The only elements of crisis under our
control are our own
preparation and response. A true warrior is prepared
to fight in any
environment on earth, protecting his or her loved
ones from threats as
varied as gunshot wounds and home intruders. And
whether a crisis is
medical, man-made, natural, urban, or rural, a base
layer of knowledge
and forethought can make the difference between life
and death.
Only the strong survive. Only the knowledgeable
prosper.
The world isn’t getting any safer. Be ready to stand
your ground.
--- Page 15 ---
PART I
PERSONAL PREPAREDNESS
--- Page 16 ---
001  Become Crisis Proof
Survivability isn’t just a matter of carrying the
right tools or following the
most punishing physical training regimen available.
Beyond muscle, brawn,
and a crisis-oriented readiness kit, the most
important element of survival
training begins with the adoption of a preemptive,
proactive mindset.
Most civilians living in relatively peaceful modern


--- Page 10 ---
societies move
through their days in a haze of passivity, assuming
the worst that will
happen is a missed deadline, a parking ticket, an
argument with a loved
one. The ground is solid beneath their feet. The only
--- Page 10 ---
risk entailed by a
--- Page 10 ---
Saturday night movie or ballgame is that the newest
superhero sequel
disappoints or their favorite team loses. But as
we’ve learned, sophisticated
urban centers aren’t immune to the threat of global
conflict or to the
unpredictable menace caused by lone actors whose
sinister plans may
escape the notice of their closest friends and
family.
A survival mindset rejects the lure of passivity and
instead prepares for a
range of undesirable possibilities—whatever their
nature and wherever
they may occur, from a mountaintop to your local
cineplex. A survival
mindset isn’t paranoid, but realistic. And it begins
with a multipronged
strategy for awareness and response to crises of all
kinds, comprised of
situational awareness, personal and cultural
awareness, active threat
reduction techniques, and the adoption of an
offensive—and not defensive
—mindset.
Situational Awareness: Whether you’re traveling or on
home ground,
reduce your vulnerability to threats by adopting
situational awareness as a


--- Page 11 ---
personal philosophy. Look outside the three-foot
bubble most civilians
inhabit as they transit through their surroundings.
Look up, look down,
stay off your mobile device. Orient yourself to your
surroundings and to
potential threats you may spot in the vicinity, and
make advance decisions
about your potential response to these threats as you
see them. Set
--- Page 11 ---
--- Page 11 ---
thresholds for defensive or offensive responses. If
the man who seems to be
following me crosses over to my side of the street, I
will duck into the next
--- Page 17 ---
place of business to call 911 and get help from
bystanders. Identify exits in
enclosed, crowded public spaces in advance.
Identifying situational risks
and thinking through crisis response in advance
allows you to act without
hesitation when emergencies strike. If and when chaos
descends, you’ll be
making your way to safety while others are still
scrambling to determine a
response.
--- Page 18 ---
--- Page 19 ---
Personal and Cultural Awareness: Combine personal
awareness with
cultural awareness to reduce the odds of being
targeted as a potential
victim. Personal awareness involves scanning your
self-presentation and
demeanor from a predator’s perspective. What does
your look telegraph to


--- Page 12 ---
thieves or violent criminals? Flashing expensive
brands and logos only
draws attention to you as a potentially lucrative
target, so favor generic
clothing and accessories. No matter the scenario, you
stand to benefit by
being the gray man or woman, a figure who passes
unnoticed through a
--- Page 12 ---
variety of contexts. Cultural awareness involves
--- Page 12 ---
scanning your self-
presentation and demeanor against the prevailing
customs of any given
environment. When you are traveling, an aversion to
ostentation should be
combined with a preference for assimilation. Tourists
and travelers are
frequently targeted as easy marks for a variety of
crimes, scams, and heists.
Altering your everyday appearance in order to blend
in with the local
population is one simple way to reduce your
visibility.
Threat Reduction: Women looking to protect themselves
from predators
can start with a few very simple measures that may
lessen their chances of
being targeted. Wear long hair in a bun rather than
loose or in a ponytail,
to avoid giving predators a handle to hold on to.
Necklaces and IDs worn
on lanyards around your neck could also be used by a
predator seeking to
gain control over you. Wear pants—predators are known
to target women
wearing skirts and dresses, and pants offer maximum
mobility and


--- Page 13 ---
protection in any kind of crisis.
An Offensive Mindset: When it comes to survival,
“self-defense” is a
natural association. But in most crisis scenarios, a
defensive mindset won’t
do you much good. If the crisis threshold has been
crossed and the moment
for action has arrived, it’s time for you to flip a
mental switch and move
into offensive mode. In confrontations with violent
adversaries, you must
match or exceed the level of aggression you are
--- Page 13 ---
--- Page 13 ---
presented with. Assume the
worst-case scenario—that your aggressor is trained in
mixed martial arts
or very accurate with his or her weapon—and fight
back with everything
you’ve got. Your life depends on it.
This spirit of aggressive counteraction is just as
applicable to natural
disasters or survival in the wild. In any crisis or
disaster scenario, your goal
is to aggressively move away from the danger as
quickly and efficiently as
--- Page 20 ---
possible, remaining in control of your emotions and
refraining from letting
hysteria take over. The fight-or-flight instinct is
powerful, but it must be
combined with clearheaded thinking for optimal
response.
Note: Each skill in this book is broken down into its
most critical parts, or
Courses of Action (COAs), introduced by a Concept of
Operation
(CONOP) and then summed up by a BLUF (Bottom Line Up


--- Page 14 ---
Front) that
spells out the skill’s key takeaway.
--- Page 21 ---
002  Build a Personal EDC Kit
Survival is a game of adaptability, and many of the
skills in this book focus
on improvised tools created from available materials
at the last minute. But
a small amount of well-chosen gear goes a long way.
Every man or woman
must tailor his or her own EDC (everyday carry) kit
to the environment
--- Page 14 ---
--- Page 14 ---
and to personal habits, but whether you’re looking to
fine-tune your kit or
starting from scratch, a few small, lightweight items
should be considered
baseline necessities (see opposite).
A bulletproof insert, custom-fitted or ordered to fit
a variety of bag
sizes, can transform your bag into a quick shield
against a gun-toting
assailant. A small flashlight has endless uses as a
navigational tool or
signaling device (page 114). A steel-barreled pen
works overtime as both a
writing device and (when stabbed into an opponent’s
eye or neck) a
weapon of self-defense. A roll of coins can be folded
into a bandana and
turned into a bone-crushing tool. The same bandana
can be used as a
tourniquet, while a tube of super glue can be used to
create improvised
sutures (page 246). A pair of Kevlar shoelaces, worn
or carried, can be
used to saw through metal. And medical shears will


--- Page 15 ---
cut through clothing
or metal wire.
In combination with the weapons a civilian might
regularly carry, a
small can of Mace provides a nonlethal means of self-
defense.
A GPS device provides navigational backup in the
event that cell phone
service is interrupted during a natural or urban
disaster, and a printed map
adds an extra layer of insurance should both devices
fail or be stolen.
Reattach purse or bag straps with carabiners if you
can—a removable
strap can be of great use during a crisis (see page
--- Page 15 ---
200), as can a length of
--- Page 15 ---
tubular nylon (page 96).
--- Page 22 ---
--- Page 23 ---
003  Train to Survive
If you don’t have the physical conditioning necessary
to get yourself out of
trouble, the skills in this book won’t do you much
good. Whether you’re
exiting a burning building or knocking a dangerous
assailant unconscious,
the ordeal will consist of surmounting the initial
crisis and then running or
crawling your way to safe ground some distance away.
At a minimum, you
want to be able to push, pull, and lift your own body
weight. Ideally,
you’ll have the strength to lift your own body weight
while also carrying a
loved one to safety.
Full-body strength and cardiovascular endurance are


--- Page 16 ---
two prongs of a
solid functional workout that will give you the
initial fortitude to pull
yourself out of a crisis—and then the endurance
you’ll need to get out of
harm’s way. An adaptable workout based on hauling,
pushing, punching,
and pulling a heavy weighted mass will have the best
chance of
approximating real-life survival scenarios.
Work through the phases of the workout in thirty-
second intervals,
starting with the Heavy Bag Sprints (see opposite).
Working the core and
the legs, these will inevitably resemble more of a
forced march than an
--- Page 16 ---
--- Page 16 ---
actual sprint. Proceed to Heavy Bag Ground Pounds,
which work arm and
back strength while engaging core rotational force.
Ground your legs
during Heavy Bag Pulls, pulling the rope hand-over-
hand to bring the bag
toward you. Alternate sides after ten reps or thirty
seconds of Heavy Bag
Squats. Proceed to another Heavy Bag Ground Pound,
this time letting the
rotational power exit through your knees as you push
the heavy bag across
the floor.
End the interval series with a quarter-or half-mile
full-speed sprint. Rest
for thirty seconds to one minute, then repeat the
sequence up to five times.
--- Page 24 ---
--- Page 25 ---
004  Prepare a Vehicle Go-Bag


--- Page 17 ---
A basement full of emergency supplies is an excellent
starting point for
disaster preparation, but the trunk of your car is an
underutilized resource.
Crisis is unpredictable, and a nimble response should
be mobile-adapted.
Conceal a vehicular go-bag beneath or beside your
spare tire to surmount
not only a flat but also a plunge into a sinkhole
(see page 196) or an
unexpected cold-weather trek toward roadside
assistance. Stock your go-
bag with items crucial for life-support and self-
defense, including but not
limited to: Carabiners. Strap down gear in a maritime
environment, hang
--- Page 17 ---
--- Page 17 ---
food supplies in the mountains, or make an improvised
seat belt.
Concealed Razor Blade. An undetectable weapon can be
a very
powerful tool.
Duct Tape. Splint a fractured bone (see page 250) or
create an Improvised
Magnetic Compass (page 20).
Dynamic Rope. Haul yourself out of a sticky
situation.
First-aid Kit. Temporarily stop bleeding in the event
of a collision.
Flares, Flare Gun, Air Horn, Whistle. The ability to
signal for help
may get you out of a very tight squeeze.
Flashlight, Lighter. A large flashlight has a
multitude of uses, and a
lighter ensures you’ll never be without fire.
Food and Water. Maintain a three-day supply to
prepare for a lengthy


--- Page 18 ---
drive out of town in the event of a large-scale urban
crisis or natural
disaster.
--- Page 26 ---
--- Page 27 ---
Handheld GPS Device. Supplement your cell phone and/
or built-in GPS
system in case both systems fail.
Multi-tool. Cut through wire, loosen screws, or saw
down metal with a
single tool.
Pistol, Ammo, Fixed-blade Knife. Arm yourself in case
things go
sideways.
Sleeping Bag, Hammock, Poncho Liner. Increase your
comfort and
--- Page 18 ---
--- Page 18 ---
endurance in survival conditions.
Warm Layers. Cars can break down anywhere, and
running your heater
overnight is a great way to wear out your battery.
--- Page 28 ---
PART II
NAVIGATION
--- Page 29 ---
005  Environmental Navigation
In a survival scenario, an overreliance on your GPS
system can be a
liability. Devices can be lost or destroyed. Under a
triple canopy or in
inclement weather, they may not be able to contact
the three or more
satellites needed for positioning. And most
important, in the absence of
street names, being able to pinpoint your position
won’t help you if you
don’t have a context for the environment’s


--- Page 19 ---
topographical landmarks.
To mitigate against these possibilities, carry a
compass, extra batteries,
and a map as backup—and perform a generalized map
study prior to
setting out into the wilderness. Your goal should be
to familiarize yourself
with the terrain within a fifteen-to twenty-mile
radius of your destination.
If you have the misfortune of getting lost, having
memorized the direction
of landmarks such as lakes, villages, mountains, and
oceans will make for
smarter decision-making on the fly.
So will an observant eye. Whether by design or by
accident, Mother
--- Page 19 ---
--- Page 19 ---
Nature provides those who pay attention with a host
of clues regarding
their whereabouts. Because most winds are western-
prevailing, for
example, trees and bushes tend to display thicker
foliage on their eastern
sides. A prevalence of branches (as opposed to
leaves) marks the southern
side of the tree, which gets the most sunlight due to
planetary tilt. And
moss growth generally favors the northern side of
trees, because moss
favors shade. This last clue only works in the
aggregate, because shade
may be coming from neighboring trees or plants. As
with all clues, make
sure you see an overall pattern before jumping to
conclusions about your
cardinal directions.
To create a makeshift emergency compass, see page 20.


--- Page 20 ---
--- Page 30 ---
--- Page 31 ---
006  Solar Navigation
Though the satellite tracking that has pervaded so
many aspects of modern
life dates back only a half century, the use of
celestial objects as
navigational tools has been around for thousands of
years. If you’ve
performed a map study and outfitted yourself with a
basic working
knowledge of the environment, tracking the movements
of our closest star
—the sun—should help you find your way to safe
ground.
The simplest way to use the sun’s movements is to
--- Page 20 ---
determine which way
--- Page 20 ---
your shadow is being cast. Because the sun rises in
the east, a morning sun
will cast your shadow to the west. Past noon, when
the sun is starting to
set in the west, your shadow will point toward the
east.
At midday, this technique will be difficult to use,
as a sun that’s high
overhead won’t cast much of a shadow at all. But if
you’re wearing an
analog watch, you have all the tools you need in
order to determine your
cardinal bearings (the direction of north, south,
east, and west). Raising
your wrist as if you’re looking at your watch, rotate
your body so that the
hour hand points directly toward the sun. The halfway
point between the
hour hand and the twelve o’clock mark on your watch


--- Page 21 ---
indicates the way
south.
If you’re unsure of the time of day, create an
improvised sundial and use
the movement of your shadow to chart your course. To
construct, place a
stick in the ground, setting a rock at the end of the
shadow cast by the
stick. Let fifteen minutes pass, then place a second
rock at the end of the
new shadow. Draw one line between the two rocks, and
another
perpendicular to the first. The end of the
perpendicular line furthest from
the stick will point toward north.
--- Page 32 ---
--- Page 21 ---
--- Page 33 ---
007  Celestial Navigation
--- Page 21 ---
Guided by the ancient practice of celestial
navigation—the star-gazing
technique that ferried countless sailors, pirates,
and explorers to distant
shores and plundered treasure—any traveler should be
able to determine
cardinal directions, even in pitch-black darkness.
Which is good news for
civilians crossing a blistering desert (see page 52)
or fleeing disaster, when
traveling after sundown may be unavoidable.
The apparent position of the stars in the nighttime
sky, and the selection
of stars that will be visible to you, will depend on
your latitude and
longitude, the season, the cloud cover, and the time
of night. In the
northern hemisphere, the North Star is an effective


--- Page 22 ---
gauge of northerly
direction. Because the star sits so near the earth’s
north pole, its position in
the sky is almost unchanging. The earth’s rotation
causes other stars to
appear to move across the sky, but the North Star
remains pinned at the
globe’s upper pole as the planet spins like a top.
The North Star isn’t the
brightest in the sky, so search for it by identifying
nearby constellations:
the Big Dipper, the Little Dipper, and Cassiopeia.
The star lies in a direct
line with the two outer stars of the Big Dipper’s
bowl (see opposite—using
the distance between those two stars as a measuring
stick, it’s roughly five
lengths away) and with the central star or topmost
point formed by the W
in Cassiopeia. The North Star is also the last star
--- Page 22 ---
--- Page 22 ---
in the Little Dipper’s
handle.
There is no consistently visible star at the southern
pole, but in the
Southern Hemisphere you can determine direction by
locating the Southern
Cross. Trace an imaginary line from the
constellation’s brightest star to the
star directly opposite, through the longest axis of
the constellation’s cross;
using the axis as a measure, the southern pole lies
four-and-a-half lengths
away, in the direction of its brightest star.
At the equator, locate Orion’s Belt. The three
horizontal stars that
comprise Orion’s belt lie along the east-west line;


--- Page 23 ---
Orion’s torso points
toward the north, his legs toward the south.
--- Page 34 ---
--- Page 35 ---
008  Magnetic Navigation
More than an entertaining science experiment, a DIY
compass is a useful
navigational aid—and like all great improvised tools,
it’s made from
materials that can be leveraged from a variety of
available sources. Electric
wiring can be found in radio speakers, flashlights,
the harness of a vehicle.
Batteries are tucked inside an endless array of
devices. And everyone
should have a roll of duct tape in the back of his or
her trunk. All you
really need is a bit of serendipity or forethought in
procuring a needle or a
slender length of steel.
--- Page 23 ---
--- Page 23 ---
Using a few simple steps, a steel needle or piece of
wire fencing can be
magnetized and employed to similar effect as store-
bought compasses,
which rely on magnetized needles that align
themselves with the earth’s
magnetic field or “magnetosphere.” An electric charge
will cause ions in
the needle to congregate at one end, and when floated
weightlessly, the
needle will automatically point north-south.
One difference between the two versions is that
store-bought compasses
are properly magnetized so that one of their needles
aligns south, the other
north. Ideally, you’d want to magnetize only one end


--- Page 24 ---
of your needle, but
this can be difficult to manage when working with
such a small and thin
gauge. So use your needle as a source of more general
information, to find
the axis representing north and south. In order to
determine which end is
which, you’ll need to confirm via another form of
natural navigation. (See
pages 14, 16, and 18.)
Note: The northern direction on a compass is actually
the earth’s northern
magnetic pole, which lies about one thousand miles
south of true north,
the earth’s geographical north pole. Improvised
compasses should be
combined with maps when possible, as they only
provide a general sense of
direction.

PART III
SURVIVAL IN THE WILD
--- Page 38 ---
009  Minimum EDC, Jungle Environment
Dark, loud, and buzzing with dangerous life forms, a
jungle can quickly
become one of the most frustrating environments on
earth, its terrain
presenting even experienced navigators with uniquely
challenging obstacles
to transit and survival. Progress at ground level is
often undertaken in near
darkness, every step impeded by thorny, sticky, and
sometimes poisonous
plant life with a supernatural ability to grab onto


--- Page 25 ---
skin or clothing. Terrain
will be overshadowed by the lush canopy of trees and
vines that makes
jungles and rainforests appear so green and idyllic
and also blocks a large
portion of visible light from the dark and damp
forest floor. The
environment is hot and humid, yet demands full
coverage for protection
against insects and plant life. Discomfort is a
given.
If you find yourself lost in a jungle, know that the
density of your
surroundings and the relentless oppressiveness of the
climate are likely to
increase feelings of panic and hopelessness. Keep
moving. Momentum is
important in a survival scenario.
How to Clear a Path Through the Jungle
Many factors can make efficient transit through a
jungle a losing battle,
but following streams or game trails may diminish the
--- Page 25 ---
--- Page 25 ---
need for trail-
clearing. Regardless of your path, a proper knife is
essential for cutting
your way through the jungle’s thick matrix of brush,
vines, and limbs, an
ever-present reality that makes even a single step a
challenge. The optimal
tool is the Kukri, an indigenous long-bladed knife
whose curved blade
shortens the overall length of the tool without
compromising blade length,
thus making it easier to carry.
To clear a path, swing the knife in diagonal motions,
using an overhand


--- Page 26 ---
hold.
For ease of access, the knife should be worn in a
leather or Kydex waist
sheath—you’ll find many uses for a sturdy knife in
the jungle, from
procuring and preparing food, to building a shelter,
to self-defense, so
you’ll want it close at hand. A sharpening stone is
also a must.
--- Page 39 ---
--- Page 40 ---
Though a jungle is the opposite of a desert in being
so densely packed
with vegetation and natural features, there are
similarities when it comes to
navigation. In both environments, a lack of
topographical differentiation
can make it easy to lose your way. Additionally, in a
jungle, GPS devices
are likely to fail due to the thickness of the
canopy. And, unlike in desert
sand, footprints may not be noticeable, increasing
--- Page 26 ---
the likelihood of circling
--- Page 26 ---
back on yourself. Travel with a map and a compass,
and use a Sharpie or
colored tape (see page 224) to mark your path as you
go. This will have
the added benefit of creating a trail for potential
rescuers.
--- Page 41 ---
Protecting Yourself from the Environment
The jungle’s plant life can inflict a surprising
amount of damage upon
unprotected flesh. Shin guards in adult and child
sizes, worn on the
forearms and lower legs, can help protect your limbs


--- Page 27 ---
from sharp, thorny
obstacles and over-emphatic swings of the blade as
you clear your path.
Forearms, shins, hands, and feet are the primary
points of contact with any
sharp brush and thorns you encounter, which makes a
pair of lightweight
leather gloves essential as well.
Any exposed skin is also vulnerable to the jungle’s
most persistent class
of predators. With potential foes ranging from
dengue-or Zika-carrying
mosquitoes to army ants and poisonous centipedes,
jungles are rife with
critters whose bites could result in a life-
threatening fever. Even a single
bite from an army ant could render your hand
inoperable for a day, so
proper coverage is essential—from a breathable long-
sleeved shirt and
pants to gaiters that seal off the lower extremities
and prevent leeches and
spiders from crawling up pant legs. Overlap clothing
and gear to create
--- Page 27 ---
--- Page 27 ---
protective seals.
For additional security, layer on panty hose under
clothing. Leeches
cannot penetrate its tight weave or obtain traction
on its slippery surface,
though they have a surprising knack for fighting
their way through layers
of clothing. A full pair may be worn on the lower
body, with a secondary
pair cut off at the feet and waist to provide
additional protection to arms.
To deal the predatory worms a final death blow, add


--- Page 28 ---
water to a pouch or
tin of chewing tobacco and let it soak for a few
minutes, then rub the
solution over extremities and onto panty hose and
clothing. No matter
how carefully covered you are, leeches will find
their way inside your
clothing, and nicotine paralyzes and kills them
faster than man-made
repellents.
A panel of mosquito netting is a baseline essential.
Wear a small patch
over your face while you’re working your way through
the jungle, and
drape the rest over your sleeping quarters (see page
34) at night. Failing to
protect yourself is not an option.
Multiple changes of socks and a breathable shoe help
keep the feet
warm and dry, an issue that pertains not only to
comfort but also to
survival. Your choice of footwear can make or break
you in the jungle. To
avoid trench foot or jungle rot, the result of the
environment’s inescapable
--- Page 42 ---
--- Page 28 ---
--- Page 28 ---
humidity and the high probability of wading through
water, steer clear of
shoes made of Gore-Tex or other non-breathable
materials. These will trap
in moisture, which can begin to degrade your skin in
less than a day. Left
untreated, trench foot can result in gangrene and the
very real possibility of
amputation. Remove socks at night and anytime you
stop to rest, to let


--- Page 29 ---
your feet dry. Hang wet socks on the outside of your
pack to dry during
transit.
--- Page 43 ---
010  Collect Water in a Rainforest
Perhaps the wettest non-aqueous environment on earth,
the rainforest
offers plenty of clean, drinkable water to visitors
who know where to look
—as well as many opportunities for taking in
dangerous parasites and
bacteria from contaminated sources. If you find a
river or stream and
happen to be carrying water filtration tablets or the
equipment necessary
to boil the water clean, you’re in luck. If not,
mitigate against the risk of
contamination by digging into the ground a few feet
from the shoreline,
where you’ll find water that’s been filtered through
the soil’s rocks and
sediment.
Even when you’re far from rivers and streams, the
humid ecosystem
offers many options for hydration. Frequent rain is
one such source, and a
container is all you need in order to collect it. No
water bottle? Cut a
--- Page 29 ---
--- Page 29 ---
segment of bamboo just above and below a joint. The
hollow plant is solid
at the joints, creating a closed-off cylinder that
can be stood upright on a
level surface.
The plant can also provide a direct source of clean
water, filtered by its
passage through the soil and the plant’s cell walls.


--- Page 30 ---
To access, cut a hole
just below a joint of live, green bamboo, then use a
smaller bamboo shoot
as a straw to drink the water that courses through
the stalk.
The rainforest’s abundant vines can be tapped
similarly in the name of
survival. The key to success is to cut two notches in
a vine, the first high,
the second (the “bitter end”) low to the ground. The
higher notch allows
air to flow in, pushing water down to the collection
point below.
A more labor-intensive but plentiful source can be
found in plantain and
banana palms, whose root systems are shaped like
giant bowls—full of
clean drinking water coming right up from the palm’s
roots. Cutting the
trunk requires muscle power and a sharp blade, but
the effort will be
worthwhile.
--- Page 44 ---
--- Page 45 ---
011  Build a Rainforest Fire
An overnight stay in a handmade bed forged from
materials found in the
environment is unlikely to be extremely comfortable.
--- Page 30 ---
--- Page 30 ---
But the addition of a
fire may make the difference between a few hours of
much needed rest and
a night spent tossing and turning.
Nighttime in the jungle can be damp and cold—and it’s
also the time
when many of the forest’s insects and predators come
to life. Though most


--- Page 31 ---
insects are attracted to light, they will be repelled
by the fire’s smoke.
Larger animals will be repelled by its flames.
Fires are obviously also essential in any survival
environment as a means
to cook food and purify water gathered from rivers or
streams. In a jungle,
you can leverage the natural abundance of highly
flammable bamboo to
light an easy-to-start blaze. Look for dried pieces
of bamboo that have
fallen to the ground and are a light tan in color,
not green.
You’ll need a knife (see page 24) to collect shavings
from the skin of the
bamboo, which will act as kindling. The plant’s core
will act as tinder and
fuel, and friction will create the spark necessary to
start any fire.
Once you’ve prepped your materials, it should only
take about twenty
strokes of your scored bamboo halves (see
illustration) to create smoke.
Blowing on or waving your hand above the kindling
will turn that smoke
into spark.
Note: Bamboo, an invasive species that is one of the
rainforest’s most
bountiful offerings, can also be leveraged as a fish-
catching spear (see page
32), a sleeping surface (see page 34), a cooking
--- Page 31 ---
vessel, or a receptacle for
--- Page 31 ---
food—among its many other uses for survival.
--- Page 46 ---
--- Page 47 ---
012  Scavenge and Spearfish Rainforest


--- Page 32 ---
Survival Food
There are as many ways to get sick in a rainforest as
there are sources of
food in this rich and life-filled environment.
Compounding the threat of
mosquito-borne tropical illnesses like malaria,
dengue fever, and the Zika
virus, food-borne ailments like trichinosis,
salmonellosis, and leptospirosis
are just as common in a rainforest as in any natural
environment. If you’re
unable to cook your food, seek out fish and insects
such as worms, grubs,
and termites. These will still be safest when cooked,
but can be eaten raw,
as the parasites they tend to carry are generally
less life-threatening than
those hosted by mammals or reptiles. They’re also
rich in proteins and the
essential fats and nutrients needed to sustain human
life.
Avoid roaches, which are well-known carriers of
disease, and brightly
colored insects, which stand a fair chance of being
poisonous. While
snakes, frogs, and other reptiles may be plentiful,
they can be coated with
salmonella and other bacteria and thus need to be
cooked for safety (see
pages 60 and 70). Snails, also common in the
environment, are fond of
dining on poisonous plants.
--- Page 32 ---
--- Page 32 ---
Depending on your starting condition and weight, you
might be able to
survive without any food for up to two months. But to
avoid going into a


--- Page 33 ---
state of semi-starvation that will make it impossible
for you to find your
way out of the wilderness, you’ll ideally want to
consume around two
thousand calories per day. That translates to about
1.5 pounds of insects
or 2 to 3 pounds of fish, or some combination of the
two.
To catch fish using a spear carved out of bamboo (see
illustration),
wade into shallow waterways and stand very still.
Fish will approach if
you don’t reveal yourself as a predator. In still
water, toss blades of grass
or other pieces of natural debris on the surface as
you see fish approach;
they will mistake the detritus for bugs and come up
to bite.
--- Page 48 ---
--- Page 49 ---
013  Build a Bamboo Hammock
The ground is the last place a visitor wants to be
when the sun goes down
and the forests’ creatures—from centipedes and
spiders to snakes, bats,
boars, and the big cats who reign above them all—come
out to feed. A
warm body on the forest floor is a perfect target for
predators, large and
small.
That’s why the optimal temporary shelter in a jungle
environment is a
--- Page 33 ---
--- Page 33 ---
cocoon-style nylon hammock (see page 25) that lifts
the sleeper up off the
ground. Small, collapsible, and easy to set up, an
adventure hammock


--- Page 34 ---
specifically made for rainforest conditions can
easily be tied from tree to
tree, with a protective swath of mosquito netting
dangling from a cord a
few feet above it. But if your primary hammock is
torn (a real possibility
given the prevalence of thorny plant life in the
environment), you can make
a quick and surprisingly durable version from a
single shoot of bamboo.
Start building your shelter well before sundown—the
forest’s thick
canopy will muffle the jungle in darkness long before
the sun actually dips
below the horizon. Select a piece of green, live
bamboo for strength, and
leverage the plant’s unique flexibility to your
advantage by splitting that
single shoot into long horizontal lines woven through
with shorter lengths
from the same shoot (see illustration). Selecting a
shoot two to three feet
longer than your height will leave sturdy knobs that
can be attached to
trees with pieces of vine, and the resulting
construction will spread apart to
absorb your body weight.
Sleeping in a suspended position does expose you to
circulating air. If
the nighttime environment is cool, layer loose brush
between the hammock
and your body to serve as extra insulation.
None of these measures may guarantee a comfortable
night’s sleep, but
--- Page 34 ---
they will maximize your chances of waking up to see
another sunrise.
--- Page 34 ---


--- Page 35 ---
--- Page 50 ---
--- Page 51 ---
014  Escape a Wild Boar Attack
What are your chances of running into a wild boar?
Higher than you
might think, given that the animal ranges across a
wider territory than
almost any other mammal on earth. Wild boar attacks
on humans are
infrequent, and the tusked animal is more likely to
run from you than
charge. But when startled, especially if accompanied
by its piglets, this
forefather of domestically bred pigs becomes a lot
less friendly than your
average farm animal.
And it runs a whole lot faster, too.
Plentiful in a variety of forest types across several
continents and
increasingly found in suburban areas around the
world, the animals are
characterized by sharp tusks, tough snouts, and
large, bony heads. These
are the tools the wild pigs use to dig and forage for
food—and the lethal
weapons they recruit as a means of self-defense. The
creatures are
legendarily ferocious when provoked, with jaws that
can easily crush bone,
and massive, armored forebodies that make them
impervious to shots fired
from a standard-issue pistol. (A .308 rifle round
would be the better
choice.)
If you spot a wild boar from a distance, steer clear
--- Page 35 ---
of its path. If the
--- Page 35 ---


--- Page 36 ---
animal is nearby, get to higher ground—climb a tree,
a car, or a large
boulder. If you are charged by a wild boar, which can
travel at speeds up
to thirty-five miles per hour, outrunning the beast
won’t be an option. But
you can take advantage of the creature’s heft and
lack of agility by doing
last-minute sidesteps.
As a method of last resort, fight back. Aim to shoot
or stab the animal
in the face, between its shoulder blades, in its
belly, or at its axillary nodes,
just beneath its front legs. Do not let the animal
take the fight to the
ground—maintain your height advantage at all costs.
--- Page 52 ---
--- Page 53 ---
015  Minimum EDC, Arctic Environment
“Pack light, freeze at night.” A common expression
among military troops
hauling 150-pound packs across frigid terrain, the
saying holds true for
wintertime campers and arctic adventurers alike. You
may be able to
maintain your core temperature while traveling
through twenty-degree
terrain during daytime, but staying warm will prove
much harder when
temperatures drop far below zero and you’ve stopped
moving for the
night.
Better safe than sorry. Pack gear in a slant-bottomed
sled in order to be
able to carry more of the large, bulky items you’ll
need for warmth. You’ll
--- Page 36 ---
--- Page 36 ---


--- Page 37 ---
consume less energy pulling supplies across snow and
ice than you will
attempting to carry them, which is important because
being as efficient as
possible about your energy expenditure will help you
stay one step ahead
of hypothermia (page 52).
Gear and Supplies
Arctic environments are ruthless, matched only by
scorching deserts in
their hostility toward human life. Assuming there’s
little chance of finding
yourself in an arctic zone by accident, proper
preparation for the
temperature extremes and food and fuel needs of this
environment cannot
be overstated. Research is essential. Know the
temperature ranges, risks of
avalanche, and weather patterns so that you can
appropriately pack for
and map your itinerary. Navigational aids (not
pictured) should include a
compass, a GPS device, and maps. If one fails, the
others can act as
backup. Sunglasses are key, as the reflection of
blinding sunlight off white
snow can make navigation a challenge. Eye strain and
photokeratitis, a
painful optical sunburn also known as sun blindness,
are also risks.
A snow anchor and a pair of snowshoes act as fail-
safes should
conditions become impassable by ski. In thick drifts
of soft powder,
snowshoes displace body weight across the wide,
webbed underside of the
shoe, reducing the amount of sinkage. If snow reaches
--- Page 37 ---


--- Page 38 ---
up to your waist,
--- Page 37 ---
--- Page 54 ---
you could expend hundreds of precious calories in the
process of traveling
just a few feet.
--- Page 55 ---
--- Page 56 ---
Should conditions become even dicier, a snow anchor
could be the tool
that allows you to stop your slide down a steep
incline. Learn to use one
before you travel. The equivalent of the Kukri knife
you’d carry in the
jungle (page 24), a snow saw and shovel are the
indispensable multi-use
tools that could enable you to catch your dinner,
build a shelter, or
surmount an unexpected obstacle.
In addition to a cold-weather tent and highly
insulated sleeping bag,
low-temperature sleeping requires a bivy sack, a thin
and nonporous
external shell layer. Sealing in as much body heat as
possible is the only
hedge against a night spent tossing and turning—or
worse. A thick sleeping
pad will help insulate you from the cold ground,
which acts as a sponge for
the precious heat you’re emitting; a folded up
“smother” or fire blanket
can fulfill the same purpose, while also providing
essential insulation
anytime you need to warm up quickly. A few lit
candles can bump up the
temperature inside a tent or snow shelter (page 48)
by a few degrees, but
must be extinguished before you go to sleep to


--- Page 39 ---
--- Page 38 ---
--- Page 38 ---
mitigate the risk of fire.
Food supplies must be extensive. The body burns
nearly twice as much
fuel in low-temperature environments, requiring food
sources that are
dense, high in fat, and plentiful. In addition to
prepackaged dehydrated
meals and energy bars, pack high-fat foods like
peanut butter, bacon fat,
nuts, and chocolate. There’s no such thing as too
many calories when your
metabolic system is working overtime to burn food
into life-sustaining
heat. Combine that with the energy expended by
hauling a heavy sled and
potentially trekking across long distances, and
you’ve got a recipe for
tremendous hunger—and rapid weight loss if caloric
intake is insufficient.
For optimal health, plan to consume five thousand or
more calories per
day, and pack extra emergency rations just in case.
Water filtration devices are a given. Though in
emergencies snow and
ice can be consumed without filtering with minimal
risk (page 42), filtering
is generally recommended, particularly if water is
coming from streams or
lakes.
Specialized camping retailers offer a great quantity
of cold-weather
items that will increase your level of comfort, but
weigh the inclusion of
additional items against the extra weight they’ll add
to your load.
--- Page 57 ---
Clothing


--- Page 40 ---
--- Page 39 ---
Your primary weapon of defense against the external
--- Page 39 ---
temperature is a
multilayer system that collects body heat and seals
out wind and cold.
Puffy, porous layers of fleece and down won’t perform
if they aren’t
properly sealed off, which is why a high-performance
outer shell is key.
Choose one in a Gore-Tex-like cold-weather material
that locks in heat but
remains slightly breathable; unlike with zero-
porosity materials, this
breathability helps wick sweat off the body.
Keeping not only warm but dry is essential in a cold
climate, as a layer
of moisture on the skin will quickly freeze when
exposed to the elements.
Wet socks in particular can rapidly cause tissue die-
off as vasoconstriction
shuts off blood supply in order to prevent heat loss
through wet feet,
which syphon off heat twenty-five times faster than
dry feet. Even in warm
but damp climates (see page 54), cotton kills.
Moisture-wicking wool socks
are a non-negotiable defense against trench foot.
--- Page 58 ---
016  Collect Arctic Drinking Water
When you’re trekking through an arctic environment,
food and warmth
will be hard to come by—but one thing you can be sure
of is that you
won’t be going thirsty. With water all around you in
the form of snow and
ice, options for hydration will never be far. And
they’re often very pure.
But the principal risk in arctic environments,


--- Page 41 ---
--- Page 40 ---
hypothermia (see page 50),
can be compounded by eating snow or ice—cold
--- Page 40 ---
substances that will bring
down your core temperature as they pass through your
neck, one of the
areas of the body that is most vulnerable to heat
loss. The neck’s carotid
arteries continuously pump a large supply of warm
blood directly to the
brain, and the jugular vein sends that supply back
down to the heart.
That’s some of your body’s most valuable real estate.
Collect Pure Water from the Environment: Though
heating water to
its boiling point is always the safest course of
action as far as purification,
fresh snow and ice collected from areas free of
standing water or other
visible sources of contamination can be consumed with
relative confidence.
Most bacteria present in the source water won’t
survive at freezing
temperatures.
Choose Ice Over Snow: The former has a greater fluid
density, while
snow is partly comprised of air.
Melt Ice with Body Heat or Fire: Fuel is precious in
glacial
environments, so leverage your body heat to melt ice
to drinkable water
when you can. If you’re appropriately layered, you’ll
release vast amounts
of body heat during transit no matter how cold the
environment. Avoiding
the brachial arteries that travel through the armpit
and the femoral arteries


--- Page 42 ---
of the inner thighs, valuable convoys for a
--- Page 41 ---
significant portion of the body’s
blood supply, place ice in a water bottle and allow
it to melt between
layers of your clothing. When stopped, conserve body
heat and switch to
--- Page 41 ---
melting ice with fire.
--- Page 59 ---
--- Page 60 ---
017  Build an Arctic Fire
When snow and ice cover the landscape, locating
materials with which to
build fire can be a challenge—but given the dire need
for a heat source in a
subzero environment, expending additional effort to
gather materials will
be worthwhile.
Despite their appearance, arctic environments may
actually be quite rich
in dormant and dead plant life. Camp near trees, and
you’re likely to find
fallen branches and dried-out ground cover beneath
the snow. Digging in
one spot may not yield results, but a treasure trove
of kindling and tinder
could be buried a foot away. Remove the outer layer
of icy or snow-
dampened bark, and you’ll find dry, usable tinder
inside. These endeavors
will be time-consuming—but depending on the
circumstances, they may
also be lifesaving.
With kindling and fuel in hand, harnessing the latent
energy of any
extra batteries you may be carrying as a fire starter
is a potentially


--- Page 43 ---
dangerous but manageable proposition. Steel wool, an
indispensable
--- Page 42 ---
scouring agent for outdoor dish washing, can be
repurposed as a bridging
mechanism. As the batteries’ charged electrons
rapidly course through the
--- Page 42 ---
wool’s fine steel threads (see illustration), they
will create a significant
amount of heat. The wool’s cocoon-like structure,
with air pockets
distributed throughout its intermeshed threads,
creates an ideal
environment for combustion.
To assemble, bridge both ends of two AA or AAA
batteries stacked
positive terminal to negative terminal (anode to
cathode) with a length of
steel wool, or plunge a single nine-volt battery
directly into steel wool.
Keep fingers away from the contact points and be
prepared to swiftly
position the wool beneath your pile of kindling. The
wool will quickly turn
red and begin to smoke.
To create a black smoke signal that will contrast an
all-white
environment, add tar-rich pinecones once your
kindling is well lit.
--- Page 61 ---
--- Page 62 ---
018  Locate Survival Foods in Subzero
Conditions
In an arctic survival scenario, maintaining core
temperature becomes the
human body’s number one priority. To that aim, the
body will sacrifice fat


--- Page 44 ---
cells, fingers and toes, and consciousness at the
outer limits. And it will
burn through any available food at nearly twice the
--- Page 43 ---
normal rate.
Keeping body temperature fifty or more degrees above
external
--- Page 43 ---
temperature is hard work, requiring a substantial
amount of fuel. While
you can survive on far less, the optimal number of
calories for functioning
at full capacity in a low-temperature environment is
five thousand. If
you’re trekking across foot-deep drifts in order to
find your way out of a
barren wasteland, you’re going to need your strength.
Look Along Shorelines: While snow-covered
environments may look
devoid of sustenance, the shorelines of arctic lakes
and rivers are frequently
home to nutritional powerhouses like mussels and
clams, which can safely
be eaten raw and can also double as bait.
Carve Fishing Holes: Finding enough fat to stoke your
body’s engines
will be a challenge, and wading into ice-cold water
in search of fatty fish
while trying to survive freezing temperatures is
inadvisable. If lakes or
riverbeds are frozen solid, however, you can use an
ice saw to carve fishing
holes into the surface. Ensure that the ice layer is
at least four inches deep
before you walk out onto it by using a knife to test
thickness from the
shore.
Set and Monitor Multiple Lines: Cut multiple fishing


--- Page 45 ---
holes to
maximize your chances of hauling in a catch, and
monitor them with
improvised bobbers. Tie lengths of fishing line to
--- Page 44 ---
pairs of sticks longer
than the diameter of your fishing holes and stacked
into X shapes. When a
fish bites, the sticks will jam across the hole.
--- Page 44 ---
--- Page 63 ---
--- Page 64 ---
019  Build Expedient Arctic Shelters
If you are forced to shelter in a wilderness
environment, a preexisting form
of natural cover will be a lucky and time-saving
find. A cave or rock
formation can provide a night’s refuge or respite
from a storm, as can trees
with dense foliage or root systems with deep pockets.
But take precautions
—a space that looks like it could provide great cover
for you may be just
as appealing to wildlife. Look for animal tracks,
feces, and trampled
vegetation before you set up camp. A polar bear or
other animal that has
staked out a prime location is likely to return.
Insulate a found space by pulling in as much
vegetation as you can,
lining the floors and walls and creating a makeshift
barricade at the
opening. Your body heat alone can warm up a well-
insulated space by ten
to twenty degrees.
When it comes to building a shelter in an arctic
environment, the
properties of snow and ice can counterintuitively be


--- Page 46 ---
leveraged to your
advantage. Like a properly insulated cave, a shelter
made of snow will trap
body heat and keep out cold air, because the high
concentration of air that
--- Page 45 ---
makes snow a less than ideal water source also makes
it a highly insulating
building block.
Digging out a pocket of space below the low-hanging
branches of a tree
--- Page 45 ---
is the quickest way to build a snow shelter, one that
leverages the
structural fortitude of a natural resource. While it
may be tempting to
burrow into a deep snowbank, beware of the risk of
collapse.
With no sign of cover in sight, a trench shelter can
be built into the
snowpack in an hour or two with the use of a snow saw
and a shovel (see
illustration). Build trench and poncho shelters
perpendicular to the wind so
that the cold air doesn’t pass through.
--- Page 65 ---
--- Page 66 ---
020  Avoid Hypothermia
Characterized by shivering, a jittery resting heart
rate, and a state of mild
confusion, the onset of hypothermia can become a
medical emergency in a
very short period of time. When shivering stops and
heart rate decreases,
you’ve moved into dangerous territory. Your core
temperature is
plummeting, signaling a slowdown in the body’s
chemical reactions, which


--- Page 47 ---
can result in death.
There is no set external temperature at which
hypothermia will occur.
Determining factors include wind conditions, the
amount of insulation a
person is wearing, the person’s level of hydration
--- Page 46 ---
and fitness, his or her
body fat percentage, and his or her exposure to
moisture. (Because water is
an excellent conductor of heat, moisture on or near
--- Page 46 ---
your skin will draw
heat away from the body.)
If symptoms occur, immediately add layers, or remove
wet clothing and
replace with dry. Insulate the body from the cold
earth with layers of
vegetation or available padding materials. If
emergency hot packs or other
sources of heat are available, place them beneath
armpits, around neck, or
at groin so they are in direct contact with arteries.
Do not use them on
hands and feet before your core has been warmed back
up—warming
extremities will cause a rush of blood back to your
core that may result in
cardiac arrest. The body naturally sacrifices blood
flow to extremities in
order to conserve resources for essential functions.
Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine, which cause
vasodilation (the
dilation of blood vessels) and increase heat loss.
Treatment for more severe hypothermia (a solution of
sugar water, the
application of mouth-to-mouth or CPR) requires
assistance from a second


--- Page 48 ---
party, so it’s essential to remedy the situation
before it’s too late.
--- Page 67 ---
--- Page 68 ---
021  Minimum EDC, Desert Environment
Trekking through an arid environment means carrying
serious quantities of
--- Page 47 ---
the number one resource required to sustain life—one
gallon of water per
person per day, plus emergency rations. But water
--- Page 47 ---
weighs more than eight
pounds per gallon, and the exertion of carrying
anything more than a
gallon and a half will cause you to lose more fluid
through sweat than
you’d be able to replenish with the water on your
back. You’ll also be
loaded up with the cold-weather gear that will enable
you to survive the
desert’s radical temperature ranges. All of which
adds up to quite a load.
Hauling that gear requires only 20 percent of the
energy that you’d expend
carrying the same load, so a mechanism that allows
you to pull rather than
carry life-support material becomes essential.
The ideal structure for hauling gear across desert
terrain is an expedition
racing cart, a simple wagon which can either be
purchased or made out of
PVC piping and bicycle tires. Double up on wheels as
pictured—flat tires
are likely on hot surfaces dotted with sharp rocks,
and a pre-attached spare
means you won’t have to stop and waste energy
changing a tire.


--- Page 49 ---
Navigation
Travel by night and sleep by day to outwit the
desert’s brutal temperature
shifts. When the sun goes down, the day’s blazing
heat can be displaced by
a thirty-degree drop in temperature. Reversing your
body clock allows you
to conserve on your water and fuel needs by saving
--- Page 48 ---
your exertion for hours
when you’ll lose the least amount of fluids through
sweat—and ensures
that your body won’t be wasting valuable kilocalories
trying to create
warmth as you sleep through a frosty night.
--- Page 48 ---
Navigating an unchangingly flat landscape in the
absence of visible
landmarks presents obvious challenges even during the
day. While
traveling by night certainly magnifies visibility
challenges, it also offers one
navigational asset: the canopy of bright stars
visible in the desert’s dark
night. (For a short course on using celestial
navigation as a backup to GPS
devices, see page 18.) The nighttime desert isn’t as
dark as you think, but
--- Page 69 ---
depth perception will be compromised after sundown.
To compensate, use
hiking poles to steady yourself.
--- Page 70 ---
--- Page 71 ---
When it comes to navigation, it’s always safest to
assume that one or
more of your tools may fail, so bring several forms
of backup and start by


--- Page 50 ---
doing a detailed map study before you set out. The
more knowledge you
have of the terrain before you start, the better
prepared you will be for a
potential emergency. In the absence of visible
landmarks, use pace
counting to keep track of the distance you’ve
traveled in any given
direction. Count every other step. A single adult
--- Page 49 ---
step spans approximately
one meter, so one hundred double-steps add up to
approximately two
--- Page 49 ---
hundred meters.
Take advantage of any opportunity to refuel. If you
spot cloud cover or
rain begins to fall, get to high ground when possible
—flash floods can
happen quickly in desert landscapes. Be sure to
collect water during any
downpour.
--- Page 72 ---
Gear and Clothing
Proper footwear is essential. Trekking shoes
specially designed to
withstand high temperatures will prevent hot spots on
the undersides of
the feet—these occur when the body pushes fluids to
contact points that
have become irritated, resulting in painful blisters
that can impede
progress. Pack blister plasters and foot powder along
with many changes
of socks. Even in desert environments, cotton socks
(see page 41) are a
liability that can very quickly lead to a dangerous
case of trench foot.


--- Page 51 ---
Lightweight wool socks will keep the feet dry and
help prevent tissue
death.
On the upper body, cotton can be useful in a very hot
environment.
Though high-performance synthetics claim to achieve
cooling and wicking
benchmarks that natural fibers cannot, under a baking
hot sun, there’s no
substitute for the breathability of cotton. Layers of
--- Page 50 ---
synthetic material that
aren’t exposed to direct sunlight can be useful,
particularly in the case of
non-chafing synthetic underwear. A lightweight scarf
--- Page 50 ---
can be used to
protect your neck and face from wind-and sunburn, and
comes in handy in
the event of a sandstorm. When in doubt, go native.
Remember: Preparing for the desert’s abrupt changes
in temperature
means you won’t be packing light. You’ll also need
adequate cold-weather
layers to pile on as you trek during the night. The
saying “Travel light,
freeze at night” is just as applicable in the desert
as it is in the arctic.
--- Page 73 ---
022  Locate Drinking Water in an Arid Desert
Your best hedge against dehydration in an arid
environment? Never get
lost in a desert without an adequate water supply.
But if you do find
yourself low on H2O, take every possible precaution
in order to conserve
your body’s remaining levels of hydration as you seek
out new sources of


--- Page 52 ---
water.
Conserve Your Internal Hydration: Stay covered when
moving during
the daytime. When the wind blows over your sweat-
dampened clothing,
you’ll benefit from a cooling effect. Better yet,
follow the desert protocol of
resting during the day and traveling at night, when
you’re less likely to
sweat and release valuable fluid (see page 52). If
you are completely out of
--- Page 51 ---
water, do not eat. Digestion will quickly use up your
remaining resources
of internal hydration.
Ascend to High Ground: When land formations allow,
ascend to high
--- Page 51 ---
ground before you shelter for the day. As you plot
the course that seems
most likely to result in rescue, look for clues that
potential water sources
might be near. From above, track vegetation and
animals. Down at ground
level, seek out signs of life.
Dig Belowground: Dry riverbeds may yield hidden
reserves of hydration
in the form of damp sand. If you find nothing after
digging at least a foot
down, try a few more spots. Even a riverbed that has
long been dry might
be harboring moisture from a recent rain.
Collect Dew: As a last-ditch effort, sacrifice part
of a night’s movement to
lay out clothes and collect the night and morning’s
dew. Using a similar
technique in drought-stricken regions, researchers
have been able to collect


--- Page 53 ---
as much as half a quart of dew from a single square
meter.
--- Page 74 ---
--- Page 75 ---
023  Spark a Fire with Sunlight
Bright sunlight may be the desert’s most abundant
natural resource—but
once the sun sets, a lack of cloud cover means the
landscape retains very
little of the day’s heat. Temperatures can drop very,
very quickly in a
desert. So if you’re not moving through the night
--- Page 52 ---
(see page 52), you’ll need
a heat source to keep you warm.
Leverage the daytime’s bright sunlight to build a
fire while you still can.
--- Page 52 ---
All you’ll need is a clear plastic bottle filled with
a bit of water or other
liquid and several sheets of newspaper; the ink on
the paper will act as an
accelerant. In the place of newspaper, dried-out
leaves and grass or
shavings from a dry branch can also be used as
kindling. Most deserts
contain plenty of highly flammable brush.
Use the convex end of the water bottle to refract or
change the direction
of the sun’s rays. As the light passes through your
makeshift lens, its rays
will converge, their heat energy concentrated into a
single hot spot. The
apparatus should magnify the power of sunlight to
such an extent that the
newspaper glows red and begins to smoke with heat.
Wave the newspaper
gently toward the lens, and that smoke will very


--- Page 54 ---
quickly erupt into flame.
Time of day and season will play a part in
determining the intensity of
the sun’s rays. This technique will be more
successful for an adventurer
working at high noon on the equator than for an
unlucky traveler caught
on a Northern Hemisphere desert in the dead of
winter.
Note: A glass bottle may also be used, potentially
rendering liquid
unnecessary if the glass is thick enough to refract
sunlight on its own,
--- Page 53 ---
without the additional magnification provided by
water.
--- Page 76 ---
--- Page 53 ---
--- Page 77 ---
024  Hunt and Scavenge Desert Survival Food
Resist the urge to rip into the first form of plant
life you come across when
trekking through a desert environment. Though
vegetation may be sparse,
plants such as the candelabras cactus or the
flowering datura plant can
induce severe vomiting or hallucination. Instead of
taking a risk, hold out
for some of the safe, edible plants commonly found
across the deserts of
North America—chia sage, prickly pear cactus, and
barrel cactus.
Embraced by the Native Americans and the Aztecs, the
chia sage has a
long medicinal history. Beat the plant’s bright
purple flower into a
container to release its seeds—nutritional
powerhouses that can be eaten


--- Page 55 ---
raw or soaked in water to form a pudding. Protect
hands while shaving
spines away from prickly pear cactus pads, also known
as nopalitos in
Latin American cooking, or burn the spines off. And
avoid drinking the
juice of the cylindrical barrel cactus; its flesh is
edible, but its liquid
contents can cause diarrhea and dehydration.
To hunt down a snake for food, locate a long, forked
stick and have a
sharp knife readily accessible. Use the forked end of
the stick to pin down
the snake’s head. Working from behind the snake,
--- Page 54 ---
slide your hand around
its jaw and forcefully clamp it shut. The snake’s
body may coil around
your stick or arm, but focus on controlling the head.
Release the stick and,
still pinning down the snake’s jaw with your other
--- Page 54 ---
hand, use your knife to
decapitate the snake.
Cut three inches below the head to make sure you’re
getting rid of any
poisonous glands, then quickly toss the head away. A
snake’s strong biting
reflex can be set off by electrical charges in its
nerve endings for up to an
hour after its death.
Though poisonous snakes can generally be identified
by their diamond-
shaped heads, it’s safest to assume that any snake
you come across might
be dangerous. A snake can lunge a distance equivalent
to half its body
length, so approach with care.


--- Page 56 ---
--- Page 78 ---
--- Page 79 ---
025  Build a Cooling Desert Shelter
When you’re in survival mode, you should perpetually
be looking to
conserve energy, and stumbling upon a preexisting
shelter is the kind of
lucky break that could help you shore up many
precious kilocalories.Your
first choices for shelter in any environment should
be natural formations.
In a desert environment, protecting yourself from
moisture isn’t usually
a concern, so sources of shade may fit the bill if
complete enclosures aren’t
--- Page 55 ---
available. An open rock formation that lets in a cool
breeze could easily
provide adequate cover. But in a sand desert devoid
of nearby land
formations, an efficient shelter can be built into
--- Page 55 ---
the sand using only two
poncho liners or tarps and a shovel—or even your bare
hands.
The two-layer shelter, pictured opposite, works by
counteracting the
greenhouse effect that normally accrues in enclosed
spaces, most notably
exemplified by a parked car on a hot day: The sun’s
UV rays enter the car
through the glass, but then cannot escape, bouncing
around until the
vehicle eventually becomes far, far hotter than the
surrounding
environment. Trapping the sun’s rays between two
tarps, open at both
ends, means that even the warmest wind can sweep


--- Page 57 ---
through and chase the
rays away before they have a chance to enter your
shelter. On a bone-dry,
windless day, the tarps will still trap UV rays and
keep your sleeping space
considerably cooler than the surrounding environment.
Digging down a couple of feet beneath the layers of
sunbaked sand will
net you a sleeping space that is many degrees cooler
to begin with.
Creating a sloped, open entrance for your quarters
ensures that air will
flow around your body as well. Build the trench
parallel to the wind, with
the sloped, open end facing into the air current.
--- Page 80 ---
--- Page 56 ---
--- Page 81 ---
026  Minimum EDC, Wetland Environment
Swamps, bogs, marshes, river flats . . . Though many
of the world’s
--- Page 56 ---
wetlands have been lost to logging, sizable examples
can still be found on
every continent but Antarctica, some of them spanning
hundreds of square
miles. Often rich sources of fish and plant life,
these fecund, low-lying
environments are some of the globe’s most biodiverse
places. But their
stagnant waters, rich in decaying organic matter, are
also highly effective
incubators for parasites, bacteria, and disease-
carrying insects.
Water is everywhere in a wetland environment, which
is why much of
the gear that’s specific to the terrain involves
keeping you and your


--- Page 58 ---
belongings as dry as possible. Wetland waters will
always be cooler than
the temperature of the human body—which means that
through
convection, prolonged immersion can result in
hypothermia even in warm
weather.
Use multiple dry bags to keep belongings free of
moisture and to
disperse weight throughout your watercraft. Even if
you’re trudging
through shallow waters, pulling a well-stocked supply
in a kayak is
preferable to lugging a partial kit on your back. Do
not abandon your gear
if you become stranded in a remote area. You may be
underestimating how
--- Page 57 ---
long you’ll be forced to depend on the survival tools
you’ve brought with
you.
Practice capsizing and reentering your watercraft
long before you have
to do so during an emergency, and tie down all gear
as a precautionary
--- Page 57 ---
measure. Boost the usefulness of your PFD (personal
flotation device) by
placing a knife, whistle, and strobe light in its
pockets. In the event that
you capsize or are separated from your watercraft,
you can use the knife to
cut yourself free from any weeds or foreign matter
you encounter, and
your whistle or strobe light to signal for help.
--- Page 82 ---
--- Page 83 ---
027  Filter Water in a Swamp


--- Page 59 ---
Water purification is non-negotiable in a wetland
environment, where
hydration may be plentiful but will almost certainly
be laced with harmful
parasites and bacteria. “Swamp fever” (a catch-all
term for malaria,
leptospirosis, and the mumps), the Everglades virus,
and cholera are just a
few of the waterborne ailments common to swamps
around the world.
These diseases can have devastating physical and
sometimes neurological
ramifications.
Though your EDC kit should contain both a water
filtration kit and a
stove with which to boil water clean, an improvised
filtration system can
also be made from a collection of found materials: a
--- Page 58 ---
plastic bottle (often
found floating around swamps near urban
environments), a sock, charcoal,
and an assortment of gravel culled from the
shoreline.
The most indispensable layer in this improvised
--- Page 58 ---
filtration system is the
charcoal, well known for its ability to bind to a
wide range of toxic
substances. In its “activated” form—when it’s been
treated for optimal
absorption—charcoal becomes the main ingredient in
most commercially
sold filtration systems, and it’s also used to tend
to ailments from
flatulence to poisoning.
To make your own charcoal, build a campfire on shore
and let it burn


--- Page 60 ---
until the logs have burned down into coals. (Store-
bought barbecue
briquettes are treated with chemicals and thus not
suitable for use as a
filtration layer.)
Organize your layers so that the largest particles
are at the top, catching
large pieces of debris, and the finest are at the
neck of the bottle. When
you pour water through your filtration system, the
drip should be slow; a
steady stream means your filtration system is too
porous.
Boiling water is the safest approach to purification
(see page 94), but
you should never die of thirst in a swamp.
--- Page 84 ---
--- Page 85 ---
028  Spark a Fire with a Mobile Phone
--- Page 59 ---
You’ve tried to use your phone to call for help, to
find your way to safety,
to contact loved ones. But after the last remaining
sliver of battery fades
away and the device goes dead in your hands, that
--- Page 59 ---
mobile phone can still
be used as a lifeline.
Outfitted with powerful batteries packed with
valuable chemical
components, personal electronic devices like phones,
tablets, and
navigational systems can be used as fire starters
long after they cease to
function. Powered by lithium ions, they are so
energy-dense that, when
shorted, their contents have a tendency to overheat
and burst into flame.


--- Page 61 ---
The first challenge will be accessing the battery,
which manufacturers
typically make difficult by design for safety
reasons. Once you’ve pried the
battery from your device, try to use any remaining
charge by bridging the
battery’s positive and negative terminals with a
knife or other piece of
metal with a nonconductive handle or grip. The
resulting spark may
succeed in getting your tinder to smoke, but a
significant shock may be the
more unwelcome by-product.
If the first approach doesn’t work, set the battery
on the ground and
rupture the battery cells by spiking the surface with
the tip of your knife.
The battery will short, releasing a burst of energy
as its protective circuit is
destroyed. Dousing the battery with water will
--- Page 60 ---
achieve a similar and
potentially even more explosive effect. The liquid
will quickly degrade the
protective circuit that prevents the battery’s cells
from mingling and
attaining peak voltage.
Stand back quickly. The battery will erupt into
flames the size of a small
--- Page 60 ---
campfire or explosion while releasing toxic
compounds.
Note: Lithium-ion fires are dangerous, toxic, and
very difficult to
suppress. This skill must only be attempted in
survival scenarios as an
option of last resort. Do not attempt to practice
these steps.


--- Page 62 ---
--- Page 86 ---
--- Page 87 ---
029  Find Food in a Wetland
Despite their often forbidding look of decay,
biodiverse wetland
environments tend to be home to an array of plant and
animal life, from
the reptiles, fish, and amphibians that dwell in
their waters to the birds and
insects whose calls and humming fill the air. One
amphibian that’s
abundant in many wetlands is the common frog, which
favors standing
water over currents. Easy to catch, the creature
yields a well-known
delicacy when relieved of its torso, its legs roasted
over a spit.
Beware of the poisonous frogs native to tropical
environments. Small
and brightly colored, they secrete lethal poisons
that can cause adverse
--- Page 61 ---
reactions like seizures, paralysis, and heart
attacks. The golden poison frog
is said to secrete enough lethal toxin through its
skin glands to send ten
adult humans to their graves—which is why native
populations historically
used those secretions to create lethal poison darts.
--- Page 61 ---
Today, pharmaceutical
companies cull the secretions and use them as the
basis for potent
painkillers.
Avoid toads, which secrete toxic substances emanating
from the parotid
glands located on the backs of their heads. Squat and
wide, toads are


--- Page 63 ---
considered less dangerous to humans than poisonous
frogs, but they can
still sometimes be lethal.
To catch a frog, use a sharpened stick to pin the
animal to the ground.
Look for frogs on muddy banks close to the shoreline,
or buried beneath
logs or rocks during colder months. They feed on
insects and earthworms,
so follow their food trail to suss them out. Frogs
tend to be most active at
night, though hunting them in the dark without a
light source is
inadvisable; a bright light will not only protect you
from potential injury,
but will also cause frogs to freeze in their tracks.
Spear in shallow waters from inside your watercraft,
or from a perch on
an improvised shelter (see page 72).
--- Page 88 ---
--- Page 89 ---
030  Build an Elevated Swamp Bed
--- Page 62 ---
If there’s little hope of reaching the shoreline
before nightfall, there are
many reasons to consider building an elevated
temporary shelter, roof, or
shelf over standing water in a wetland environment.
Sleeping on your
--- Page 62 ---
watercraft will expose you to cold and damp, and to
possible undesirable
encounters with water moccasins or alligators.
Assuming you had the forethought to pack a hammock
(see page 34),
you may want to build a roof over your sleeping
quarters to protect you
from the elements—or from aerial surveillance. A


--- Page 64 ---
shelf could be useful as a
surface on which to build a fire (in an enclosed
container like a cooking
pot), a perch from which to fish, or a docking
station from which to work
on a vessel in need of repair.
To build, look for three trees that create a
triangular pattern sizable
enough to act as a sleeping or work surface. Collect
three straight branches
long enough to extend from tree to tree; in this
environment, you may need
to do some climbing in order to find them. Strip the
branches down and
lash them to the trees using parachute cord,
rapelling line, or vines and
bark shavings collected from the environment.
Lash each branch individually from tree to tree to
increase the overall
strength of your shelter.
Lay a tarp over the frame, wrapping and tightening it
around the edges.
Or create a taut surface by weaving and lashing vines
--- Page 63 ---
and large leafy
branches over and around the frame.
Leave the structure in place when you transit to your
next location if
you want to sow a trail of bread crumbs for potential
rescuers. If you don’t
want to be found, dismantle the structure.
--- Page 63 ---
--- Page 90 ---
--- Page 91 ---
031  Minimum EDC, Mountain Environment
With specialized equipment becoming more and more
streamlined in recent
decades, we’ve condensed our food, camping, and


--- Page 65 ---
survival needs down to
the single pack we can carry on our shoulders. But we
often do so at
expense to our energy levels, our joint health, and
our ability to fully
prepare for the vagaries of the environment. Early
explorers would never
have attempted an expedition without an assortment of
pack mules and
wagons, and while we don’t want to compromise our
independence, we
can use a modified form of transport to approximate
their pioneering
ways.
If trail conditions and regulations allow, a mountain
bike provides a
form of locomotion that broadens your options as it
lightens your load.
Store camp and survival essentials like cookware,
water filtration supplies,
water, and navigational tools in one dry bag. Another
bag should hold the
food appropriate to your expedition (MREs, dehydrated
rations, energy
--- Page 64 ---
bars), and yet another should contain your clothing.
Pack for the varying
temperatures that are common to mountain environments
by bringing
light, midweight, heavyweight, and shell layers. Do
not skimp on socks.
(See page 27 for a reminder of their importance.)
Carry bulky, lightweight
--- Page 64 ---
sleep gear in a pack on your back.
An inflatable personal dinghy that packs down to
approximately
football size, along with a paddle that breaks down


--- Page 66 ---
into four lightweight
pieces, is a useful hedge against impassable
waterways that would
otherwise cause lengthy detours. Lay your bike across
your lap or the bow
of the dinghy as you ford the river or lake.
This methodology, familiar to athletes who’ve
competed in multi-day
adventure courses, is an update on the scouting model
of mountaineering
that allows for maximum mobility and flexibility.
--- Page 92 ---
--- Page 93 ---
032  Purify Mountain Water
Thinking of taking a sip of that crystal-clear
mountain springwater
without filtering or boiling it? If you’re at a high
enough elevation, the
water will generally be pure, but you never know
whether an animal has
been bathing or defecating just a few hundred feet
upstream.
Cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, shigellosis, and the
norovirus are just a few
of the bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections
--- Page 65 ---
that can result, but boiling or
filtering water will effectively kill or sequester
most impurities. Bring water
to a rolling boil to purify, and keep at a boil for
one minute, plus one
additional minute for each one thousand feet of
altitude, just to be safe.
--- Page 65 ---
In the absence of a workable pot, you can boil stream
water in a plastic
bottle filled all the way to the top, making sure no
air pocket is left inside.


--- Page 67 ---
Because plastic melts at a higher temperature than
water boils, you’ll be
able to heat the bottle without melting it. Use a
piece of rope or strong
string to tie the bottle to a tripod made of sticks.
Due to the lack of
oxygen, the water will not visibly boil, but tiny
bubbles will appear when
boiling temperature is reached.
If you’re unable to build a fire, employ nature’s
built-in filtration system
by digging a hole near the water’s edge and using
socks or other pieces of
cloth to soak up hydration. The liquid will have been
partially filtered
through layers of soil and rock.
Avoid standing pools of water. Bacteria thrive in
warm, wet
environments where they are undisturbed by current.
Keep your hands clean. Some experts believe the
transmission of
bacteria from hand to mouth to be more of a threat to
outdoor enthusiasts
than waterborne bacteria.
Note: Plastic bottles will leach carcinogenic
contaminants when heated, so
--- Page 66 ---
the plastic bottle boiling method is to be used only
as a last resort.
--- Page 94 ---
--- Page 95 ---
033  Build a Fire with Damp Wood
Even in a damp environment, if wood is plentiful, a
--- Page 66 ---
successful fire will be
within reach. Follow these fire-making tips,
applicable to any setting, to
make sure yours burns hot and strong.


--- Page 68 ---
1. Seek out pine needles or sticks that are coated in
or filled with highly
flammable sap.
2. If you find a wet log, peel off a couple of layers
of bark to expose
dry wood.
3. A smooth log with a large mass won’t burn very
well. Split larger
pieces of wood to expose their ragged internal
surfaces.
4. You need fuel, spark, and air to make a fire. To
make sure the last
element is in bountiful supply, shape logs into a
teepee triangle or a
lean-to that allows room for air to circulate. A pile
of sticks will
eventually smother itself.
5. Travel with fire starters like Vaseline, hand
sanitizer, or a dedicated
store-bought product, or collect lint from your
dryer, douse it in
lighter fluid, kerosene, or gasoline, and store it in
a Baggie.
6. Light the fire from the windward side, blocking
the wind with your
body so the flames don’t blow out before they’re
burning strong.
--- Page 67 ---
7. Light your fire from below. Fire burns upward, and
lighting from the
lowest point gives the flames every opportunity to
climb.
8. A good supply of tinder (pine needles, brush, dry
leaves) is the
lifeblood of an effective fire.
9. There’s no overstating the importance of tinder.
Add hefty pieces of
--- Page 67 ---


--- Page 69 ---
wood too early, and your fire will go out. Keep
adding tinder until
your fire has the strength to burn a bigger log.
10. Unless strong winds are burning down your fire, a
fire pit may be
isolated from the airflow necessary to keeping a fire
burning. Instead,
build your fire atop a mound of dirt.
--- Page 96 ---
--- Page 97 ---
034  Find Food in the Mountains
Game is abundant in many mountainous regions. But if
your aim is to
transit through the environment and find your way to
safety within a few
cycles of light and darkness, you don’t have time to
waste building or
setting traps—or potentially contracting a severe
digestive ailment from
improperly cooked animal flesh. Your goal should be
to continue your
movements across the landscape, gathering any edible
vegetation you come
upon and casting a line if you are fortunate enough
to find a body of
water. Many of the world’s lakes and rivers are
swarming with fish, so
unlike an attempt to catch up a rabbit, casting a
--- Page 68 ---
line in a survival scenario
is an appropriate use of your energy and time.
Setting up a trotline is one way to maximize your
chances of catching a
fish. Attach multiple segments of fishing line, of
varying lengths, to a string
of parachute cord or a strong vine. Bait and hook the
lengths of fishing
--- Page 68 ---


--- Page 70 ---
line, then anchor the string to a tree, a bush, or a
rock on one end, sinking
it with a weighted water bottle or large rock on the
other. When you see
the line move, haul in your catch.
As you’re performing a map study in advance of
transiting through the
environment, familiarize yourself with the edible
plants and insects native
to the area. Commonly available and safe sources of
fats, nutrients, and
proteins include pine nuts (the seed of the pine
tree), clover, and grubs and
earthworms. Select dried-out pinecones whose scales
have already opened,
smashing them against the ground to release their
seeds. Sour root clovers
are a particularly tasty member of the clover family,
but typically any type
of clover is edible and harmless. As a general rule,
any plant you see
animals eating is likely to be safe for human
consumption.

035  Build Efficient Mountain Shelters
At close range, the optics on a mountain can be
extremely deceiving.
Viewed from afar, the idyllic trail you climbed
--- Page 69 ---
belongs to a massive,
unforgiving ecosystem with the power to alter wind
and weather patterns
for hundreds of miles. And come nightfall, or when a
cold front suddenly
blows in, a sun-drenched rocky outcropping can become
an ice-cold,
--- Page 69 ---


--- Page 71 ---
windblown tundra in a matter of minutes.
If you’re forced to shelter overnight on a mountain
without a tent,
insulation will be key. When you’re hiking or driving
through
mountainous terrain, a poncho (stashed in the trunk
of your car or a
backpack) is a light and useful form of insurance
that can be deployed as a
tent, rain cover, ground cloth, or insulating layer
in the event of an
unexpected sleepover. In warmer weather, a sleeping
bag and bivy sack
may be sufficient to get you through a night spent
under the stars, but
better safe than sorry.
To prevent a sudden rain from dousing you in feet of
rushing water,
check to make sure the ground you’re sleeping on
isn’t a dried-up creek-or
riverbed. Stake out flat, elevated ground free of
scat or large animal tracks,
ideally near trees.
If you’re traveling with quality tools (see page 74),
you should be able to
make an insulated shelter out of branches and
foliage. Ski poles, hiking
poles, or ice axes can be substituted for tree trunks
or stumps to create
both poncho tents and lean-tos.
--- Page 70 ---
Before you set out on any trip through an unpopulated
area, do a
thorough map study. If you’re stranded on a
mountaintop, even a basic
knowledge of the surrounding area (e.g., knowing that
the closest town is
due east) may help you find your way to safety. In


--- Page 72 ---
the absence of
topographical knowledge, follow rivers and streams
downstream.
--- Page 70 ---
--- Page 100 ---
--- Page 101 ---
036  Emergency Climbing Techniques
Inexperienced climbers generally make the same
mistake: over-relying on
arm strength, a bias that quickly results in fatigue
for all but the most
overbuilt. Whether you’re climbing a mountaintop or
the side of a
building, you’re far better off recruiting the
powerhouse muscles of your
legs and core, spreading the effort throughout the
body rather than
delegating the work to a single, isolated muscle
group. The key to
successful climbing is to revert to the natural,
full-bodied movements
toddlers instinctively use to escape their cribs and
playpens—before they
gradually unlearn the human body’s natural facility
for climbing over and
around obstacles.
The principle of full-body climbing is easy enough to
grasp when it
comes to chimneying or stemming up a narrow chute
(see illustrations). To
chimney, brace back and feet against opposing
--- Page 71 ---
surfaces and walk up the
walls, shifting pressure between opposing hands and
feet to ascend. To
stem, spread the body in a wide X position, and use a
sideways crab walk
to gain elevation.


--- Page 73 ---
To hoist the body over a ledge, use arms and legs to
raise the chest to
ledge level—then recruit the legs, hooking a heel on
--- Page 71 ---
the overhang.
When dangling on a steep incline, your arms shouldn’t
necessarily
always be the highest point. If you can identify a
third point of contact
within reach, hold your body as close to the wall as
possible, then scissor
up a leg to hook the heel. Once you’re stable,
release a handhold and reach
for the next contact point.
When using the hands for grip, apply the whole-body
principle to the
hands themselves. Rather than letting the weight
dangle from your fingers,
distribute the tension of the grip throughout the
hand. And remember: Not
all holds are horizontal. A vertical protrusion can
be equally useful in a
moment of crisis.
--- Page 102 ---
--- Page 103 ---
037  Survive a Bear Attack
If you run into a black bear on a mountain trail, be
grateful for your good
fortune. Compared to polar bears and brown bears,
black bears are much
less likely to attack. Brown bears (sometimes also
known as grizzly bears)
--- Page 72 ---
are the most aggressive species of bear, while polar
bears are always
hungry—and unlike black and brown bears, polar bears
will actively track
and hunt down humans across their arctic terrain.


--- Page 74 ---
Their massive height
and heft make them formidable opponents, capable of
disemboweling prey
--- Page 72 ---
with a single swipe of their claws.
Human-bear interactions have become increasingly
frequent as various
regulations and conservation efforts have swelled the
bear population
across North America, with black bear sightings
particularly on the rise.
Fortunately, bear attacks are very rare in general—
you have a 1 in 2.1
million chance of being mauled, which means that
almost any routine daily
activity has a greater chance of killing you. But
activities such as bow-
hunting for elk in the mountains of Montana or
backpacking in the
Yellowstone range will significantly increase your
risk of a lethal attack.
And there’s no discounting the occasional suburban
visitor who rifles
through Dumpsters or even locks himself inside the
family sedan.
Commonsense Precautions
The number one reason for bear attacks? Humans
getting too close for
comfort. Give bears an extremely wide berth, and
never get between a
female bear and her cubs. If you spot a bear from a
distance, change your
route. Stay quiet, so as not to pique the bear’s
--- Page 73 ---
interest. Should a change in
direction be impossible, do not proceed until the
bear has been out of sight
for thirty minutes.


--- Page 75 ---
If you’ve spotted bears in the vicinity, clap your
hands and use your
voice to emit a steady stream of noise as you
transit. Bears have a
formidable sense of smell, so when you’re stopped for
the night, follow the
commonsense strategies of double-bagging and hanging
--- Page 73 ---
your food. Place
food, cookware, and utensils at least one hundred
feet from your tent, and
--- Page 104 ---
never set up camp near bear scat or tracks. Store any
scented products
(toothpaste, soap) with food and cooking supplies. Do
not sleep in the
same clothing you cooked in, as food scents may
remain on fibers.
--- Page 105 ---
--- Page 106 ---
Transit through bear country with two or more
companions if possible
—bears don’t tend to attack groups.
Carry bear spray (a form of pepper spray), which has
been shown to be
more effective than handguns at deterring bear
attacks, and a whistle.
Grizzly bears are currently protected as a threatened
species in the lower
forty-eight states, so killing one will result in a
federal investigation
complete with forensic analysis.
If the bear is close and has spotted you, get big.
Wave your arms around
--- Page 74 ---
and make noise. Often this strategy will make bears
stop in their tracks
and run off.


--- Page 76 ---
--- Page 107 ---
When Bears Attack
If the bear charges you, this is the moment to use
--- Page 74 ---
bear spray or shoot.
Dispense bear spray when the bear is within forty
feet, or aim rifle sights at
a spot below its chin, or just behind its front legs
if shooting broadside. If
you are unarmed, stand very still. The bear may be
doing a false charge to
test your mettle as a potential predator, and could
lose interest once it sees
that you are not a threat.
If the bear attacks, most experts agree that this is
the moment to lie
down and play dead. You want to convince the bear
that it has done its
job and effectively minimized the perceived threat
you posed. Lay flat on
your stomach to protect your organs, crossing your
hands behind your
neck to guard your arteries. Or curl into the fetal
position, covering the
back of your neck with your hands. Playing dead is an
effective strategy
with a 75 percent success rate; because most bear
attacks are defensive in
nature, bears will back down once they recognize that
you are not a threat.
Of course, nothing is predictable in the wild. Bears,
though omnivorous,
subsist mostly on plants and fish—but they have been
known to feast on
human flesh.
--- Page 75 ---
Never turn your back on a bear, and never try to run.
Both of these


--- Page 77 ---
actions can kick-start a bear’s predatory reflexes—
and you’ll never be able
to outrun a bear, as the animals can travel at up to
thirty miles per hour.
Instead, slowly walk away sideways, keeping an eye on
the animal so that
you can monitor its movements.
--- Page 75 ---
If playing dead does not cause the bear to lose
interest, you are the rare
victim of a predatory attack. The bear intends to
kill and possibly eat you,
so fight back with any available weapons—a knife,
sticks, rocks, your fists.
Aim for the eyes and nose, where the bear is most
sensitive.
There’s no tried-and-true, written-in-stone protocol
for handling a bear
attack, in part because attacks are so rare. So it’s
no surprise to find debate
among bear-country dwellers about how to handle a
grizzly charge versus
an encounter with a black bear. Some say that playing
dead is more likely
to work with the former, claiming that the latter’s
less frequent attacks are
more likely to be offensive. But all agree that
pepper spray is the single best
deterrent, one so effective that it has been used
successfully by children
under the age of ten.
--- Page 108 ---
038  Cross Rapids Safely
Look both ways before you cross. Better yet, avoid
crossing rivers entirely
if you know you are going to be exposed to the
--- Page 76 ---
elements for any length of


--- Page 78 ---
time. Wet shoes and socks can lead to serious
problems a few miles down
the road, and rapids can be stronger than they
appear.
If you must cross a river with fast-moving currents,
scope out areas
upstream or downstream of your position, seeking out
a path that will
make your crossing as efficient and safe as possible.
--- Page 76 ---
Crossing
straightaways between two bends may allow you to take
advantage of a
slowdown in current after a curve. Look for shoals or
shallow points that
may allow you to hop from one dry spot to another.
Avoid a visible pileup
of debris along an embankment, which could indicate
strong currents and
may entail a risk of getting trapped. A gathering of
ripples is a likely
indicator of a mass of rocks, another obstacle that
could make a crossing
more difficult.
To cross on foot, locate a long stick—adding a third
leg to your walking
posture will increase your stability. Face the
current, and make your
crossing slow and steady. Rushing will only increase
the likelihood of
getting knocked off your feet.
Cross deep, rushing waters only as an option of last
resort. If you must
swim, strip and place gear in a large garbage bag.
Tie off the bag securely,
leaving air inside so that the inflated bag functions
as a flotation device.
--- Page 77 ---


--- Page 79 ---
Swim diagonally up current to counter the effects of
drift.
--- Page 109 ---
--- Page 110 ---
039  Minimum EDC, Maritime Environment
Though cruise ships carry a supply of emergency
survival rafts and require
passengers to submit to safety drills, deep sea
fishing expeditions or
--- Page 77 ---
voyages aboard private yachts may take a more casual
approach to
emergency prep. Familiarize yourself with basic
strategies for deep sea
survival in order to hedge against the unexpected.
Generally stocked on larger vessels, emergency
survival rafts are
constructed to automatically inflate upon hitting
water. Some older models
will require you to unscrew a valve, but generally
won’t involve inflating
the raft while passengers are still onboard the ship.
Shipowners assembling their own maritime EDC kits
should stockpile a
variety of signaling, navigational, medical, and
life-support essentials.
Rafts should be outfitted with external lights that
will be seen by passing
boats in the night, as well as flares, flare guns,
and ChemLights that allow
passengers to actively signal to get the attention of
aircraft and nearby
vessels. The earth begins to bend at seven nautical
miles at sea level, but a
flare gun enables passengers to send signals one
thousand feet up into the
air, where they can be seen by ships or aircraft many
more miles away.


--- Page 80 ---
--- Page 78 ---
Rafts should be stocked with paddles, but passengers
should not make
uneducated decisions about navigation unless they can
see their way to
shore. Their best chance of rescue will be to drop
anchor and remain close
to the shipwreck, the site of any last-minute
transmissions that may have
been caught by the coast guard.
If a GPS device indicates that a shoreline is within
twelve miles, an
attempt to reach the shore may be worthwhile, but
--- Page 78 ---
activating a personal
location beacon (PLB) that beams out your location on
rescue frequencies
may turn out to be a more useful maneuver. Devices
that depend upon
satellites function very accurately on open water,
where signals won’t be
interrupted by tall buildings or dense vegetation.
--- Page 111 ---
--- Page 112 ---
040  Convert Seawater to Drinking Water
Water everywhere, but not a drop to drink. No truer
words were ever
spoken in a maritime environment, where drinking salt
water will only
hasten your demise. As the kidney begins to work
overtime to purge the
body of excess salt, the body expels liquid faster
than it can be replenished,
with fatal dehydration the rapid result. But by using
a pocketknife or razor
and a couple of found objects, you can create an
improvised desalination
system that harnesses the single resource most
abundant at sea.


--- Page 81 ---
--- Page 79 ---
Leaving the cap screwed on, cut off the bottom from
an empty
cylindrical water bottle (the bigger the better) and
discard. Cut off and
discard the top from an aluminum beverage can. Fold
the bottom of the
water bottle up into itself, rolling up the plastic
to create a gutter of two
inches or more. Fill the open can with seawater and
place it on a solid
surface. Place the bottle over the top of the can.
--- Page 79 ---
The heat will evaporate
the water, which will rise and condense on the
interior surface of the bottle
while the salt is left behind inside the can. As
droplets accumulate on the
plastic, they will slide down into the gutter you’ve
created. Let the
receptacle sit in the sun until a sufficient amount
of drinkable water has
accumulated.
Though we rely on the formula of a gallon of water a
day for emergency
preparedness, under survival conditions human beings
can live on a liter—
which translates to a quarter of a gallon or one tall
bottle of water, less if
you’re able to find high-moisture foods like fish and
seaweed rather than
subsisting on emergency food rations. Without any
water at all, fatality
will result in three to five days, depending on
external temperature,
genetics, and starting level of hydration.
--- Page 113 ---
--- Page 114 ---
041  Reinforce Food Supplies While Drifting at


--- Page 82 ---
--- Page 80 ---
Sea
Though the human body can survive thirty days without
food, depending
on your personal supply of good luck it may take as
long to catch a fish.
So in the event of a shipwreck, don’t assume you’ll
be able to coast on
your emergency food supply. Begin to ration food
immediately, and gather
improvised materials in order to construct a net and
--- Page 80 ---
/or a set of fishing
tackle.
Any piece of material can be used as an improvised
net, from the shirt
off your back to a poncho liner to a pair of pants.
Tie shirt arms to a
paddle or stick and knot the bottom of the shirt.
Submerge the shirt so that
fish can swim into the “net” through the neck
opening.
Creativity will come in handy in assembling
improvised fishing tackle. If
emergency food supplies include canned food or
beverages outfitted with
aluminum pull tabs, these can be used as hooks. Cut
or break off the larger
of the tab’s two rings at the midline to create the
hook, and thread your
fishing line through the smaller ring. Work with what
you have. The
needle of a safety pin can be twisted into a hook,
but even a pair of scissors
lifted from an emergency medical kit could be jammed
open and put to
good use. A length of fishing line can be fashioned
from either dental floss


--- Page 83 ---
or paracord, the nylon utility cord that’s a favorite
--- Page 81 ---
among both members
of the military and serious outdoor enthusiasts. Also
referred to as 550
cord for its maximum weight-bearing ability, the cord
can be split into six
smaller strands, each capable of holding about a
hundred pounds.
While a seagull sighting may be a sign that land is
nearby, that landmass
could be uninhabited—and any animal that enters your
orbit should be
considered potential food. While the odds of
successfully clubbing a seagull
--- Page 81 ---
may seem low, there have been several instances of
shipwreck survivors
who have done just that.
--- Page 115 ---
--- Page 116 ---
042  Create Improvised Flotation Devices
Even at temperatures of sixty to seventy degrees,
submersion in open
waters can quickly cause hypothermia to set in. Long
before muscles
would ordinarily fatigue from treading water,
disorientation and a lack of
muscle coordination will result. Securing a flotation
device becomes
essential as energy wanes.
In the event of shipwreck, the safest course of
action is to remain as
close as possible to the sunken ship’s debris. A
Mayday call placed by the
ship’s crew would have alerted coast guards and
nearby boats to the ship’s
last known position. And if you are stranded without


--- Page 84 ---
a working raft, the
debris will also become part of your survivability
--- Page 82 ---
plan.
Large cans, barrels, and any other empty containers
can be gathered and
tied together to create a makeshift buoy. Water
bottles can be grasped onto
or shoved inside clothing once you’ve drunk their
contents and screwed the
cap closed. Trash or other plastic bags can easily be
inflated by being
swept through the air. Clasp the openings in your
fists as you swiftly
plunge the bags down into the water to create bobbing
--- Page 82 ---
balloons with a
high level of buoyancy.
Even a pair of pants can be transformed into an
improvised flotation
device, a survival trick familiar to many young
graduates of scouting
courses. To execute, tie knots at the bottom of pant
legs and zip and
button the fly. Grasping the pants at the waistline,
fling them forward so
that the waistband traps air in the legs before
entering the water.
--- Page 117 ---
--- Page 118 ---
043  Survive a Shark Attack
For all the widespread horror their jaws incite,
sharks rarely attack
humans—and when they do, they’re far more likely to
bite once and swim
away in search of the high-fat flesh they prefer than
they are to strike
repeatedly. In the average year, the number of


--- Page 85 ---
worldwide fatalities from
shark attacks won’t exceed the single digits, and
attacks in total number
--- Page 83 ---
less than a hundred. But of course, a single shark
bite can be fatal if it
ravages organs or causes massive internal bleeding,
and sometimes sharks
latch on and won’t let go. In the latter case,
punching a shark in the nose
or ripping its gills may persuade it to disengage.
If you unexpectedly find yourself in shark-infested
waters, stay vertical.
Floating horizontally makes you a bigger and more
visible target from a
--- Page 83 ---
shark’s deep-sea perspective. One of the reasons
surfers are such frequent
targets of shark attacks, besides their proclivity
for dangerous waters, may
be the shape of their boards. Backlit by the sun and
crowned by a surfer’s
outstretched arms, the large oblong boards may give
sharks the mistaken
impression that they’ve landed a seal or sea lion.
Despite spending significant amounts of time in deep
waters and
occasionally being sideswiped by sharks, the SEAL
community has proven
largely immune to shark attacks. There’s no
explanation for this
phenomenon, but the reigning hypothesis holds that
the fish could be
repelled by the sound emitted by the Dräger
rebreathers worn by SEALs.
Though the theory remains untested, clanging metal or
glass objects
together may be a worthwhile method to explore if


--- Page 86 ---
sharks are circling and
rescue seems unlikely. (Though shiny metal jewelry
that reflects sunlight
could also attract the curious fish.) Or you could
--- Page 84 ---
always borrow from the
tongue-in-cheek SEAL mantra: “See a shark? Stab your
buddy and swim
away.”
--- Page 119 ---
--- Page 120 ---
044  Defend a Ship Against Pirates
The Somali pirates who once freely roamed the Horn of
Africa have been
tamped down by international counterpiracy efforts in
--- Page 84 ---
recent years, but
there’s no telling which corner of the world’s oceans
these and other
violent criminals will colonize next. Armed with
rocket-propelled grenades,
assault rifles, and grappling hooks, the deadly
hijackers seek multimillion-
dollar ransoms from the shipping companies whose
boats they target,
along with the occasional cruise ship. Quick to
execute their victims when
security forces close in, they’ve also been known to
hold hostages for years,
refusing to submit until their demands are met.
Despite the typically light security detail present
aboard luxury liners,
the hijackers’ success is not a foregone conclusion,
and a number of boats
have repelled pirate attacks using the low-tech means
pictured here. If your
watercraft isn’t outfitted with an LRAD, a long-range
acoustic device that


--- Page 87 ---
directs a piercingly high-pitched tone at invading
vessels, one of the
following methods may come in handy.
Given the susceptibility of ships to devastating
fires, every boat comes
--- Page 85 ---
equipped with a multitude of fire hoses. A ship’s
captain and crew should
freely avail themselves of these as lifesaving
defense systems, blasting
pirates with powerful jets of water. If they aren’t
toppled overboard, the
resulting chaos will make it difficult for the
pirates to take accurate shots.
Set to full blast, hoses can also be lowered over the
sides of the ship, where
they’ll turn into violently twisting snakes whose
slippery output renders a
climb almost impossible.
--- Page 85 ---
If the pirates’ small vessels are within throwing
distance, any available
projectile is fair game. Liquor bottles pilfered from
the ship’s supply can be
stoppered with tampons, the string set aflame as they
are thrown
overboard. The Molotov cocktail will explode on
impact, mingling with
any gunpowder aboard the pirates’ vessel to create a
highly repellant blast.
--- Page 121 ---
--- Page 122 ---
PART IV
DEFENDING YOUR DOMAIN
--- Page 123 ---
045  Fortify Your Home Security
Most homeowners think of home security as a simple
checklist. Install


--- Page 88 ---
decent locks, consider an alarm system, make sure
window locks are
working properly, and you’ve done your job. But
effective home security
consists in surrounding your home with active,
concentric layers of
--- Page 86 ---
security, starting with the outermost layer: the eyes
and ears next door and
across the street.
Create a Sense of Watchful Community Building rapport
with
your neighbors is one of the most important things
you can do to
protect your home. A neighbor who is invested in your
relationship and familiar with your routines is less
likely to be a
--- Page 86 ---
complacent bystander to suspicious activity. Choose
the right
neighbors from the start—most break-ins are
perpetrated by bad
actors living within two miles of your home.
Control the Information
Always let neighbors know when you’re going to be out
of town for any
prolonged period of time. Have mail and deliveries
held while you’re away,
and check social media settings before posting
vacation pics. Do not
broadcast to the entire world the fact that your home
has been left
unattended.
Information gleaned from social media could
potentially be used to rob
your home while you’re away, or to stage a virtual
kidnapping that extorts
money from your loved ones based on the false


--- Page 89 ---
pretense that you’ve been
abducted while traveling (see page 162).
In general, favor privacy on social media settings.
We’ve learned time and
again just how porous the security systems of major
tech companies can
be, and nimble criminals will continually find new
--- Page 87 ---
ways of exploiting those
very loopholes. Be particularly wary of broadcasting
information about
your children online.
--- Page 124 ---
--- Page 125 ---
Limit Visibility
Working from the outside in, the next set of eyes on
your home are those
--- Page 87 ---
of a malicious perpetrator. Your goal in this respect
is to limit a potential
intruder’s sight lines and access, while increasing
your visibility of the
perimeter of your home. To this end, start by keeping
vegetation near your
house sparse and neatly trimmed. Don’t give criminals
a place to hide.
Generously install lighting around the property.
Lighting the perimeter
of your house at night will tend to scare off the
most malevolent class of
criminals—for those who strike at night tend to be
less interested in your
belongings and more interested in harming you.
--- Page 126 ---
Tell a Story
Many homeowners know to set interior and exterior
lights on timers when
they’re away overnight or for extended periods, but


--- Page 90 ---
you can go a step
further by using programmable lighting to your
advantage, staggering
lights to tell a story. A house that is suddenly
illuminated at the same time
every night lets a watchful intruder know that timers
are in play. Scramble
the intruder’s perceptions by staggering timers, room
--- Page 88 ---
by room and floor by
floor. Early in the night, activate lights in the
kitchen and living room
areas. As the evening progresses, these lights should
gradually be
deactivated as bedroom lights come on.
To reduce visibility to outsiders of your home and
belongings while
keeping them guessing as to your routines, keep
windows covered as much
--- Page 88 ---
as possible, whether you are home or not. Park your
car inside your garage
and shut and lock the door (see page 110). Using your
driveway as a
parking spot gives intruders far too much information
about your pattern
of life.
Collect ID-Quality Footage
Many security cameras are improperly positioned,
giving homeowners a
false sense of security. To increase the
effectiveness of your home security
system, be sure camera placement and focal lens
length are thoughtfully
considered. A camera that spans your entire front
yard may create a more
dynamic view, but it won’t come in handy when it’s
time to collect ID-


--- Page 91 ---
quality footage of an intruder. A camera narrowly
focused on a walkway
or door will have a much better chance of delivering
results. On the other
hand, a wide-angle lens can be useful in collecting
make, model, color, and
direction of travel on suspicious vehicles.
Opt for a targeted assortment of lens lengths,
combined with proper
--- Page 89 ---
camera placement.
Though color may seem like the most up-to-date
option, black-and-
white cameras are better at collecting quality images
in low light.
Visible cameras also act as a deterrent, as do
security signs and stickers
—and there’s no law against faking your enrollment in
an invented security
system. Similarly, women living alone may place large
pairs of men’s shoes
beside their front and back doors to simulate the
presence of a male in the
--- Page 89 ---
household.
--- Page 127 ---
046  Profile a Home Intruder
Because protecting your home and its inhabitants
starts with an awareness
of suspicious activity on the perimeter of your
property, a key component
of home security is a level of basic knowledge about
the profile of the
average intruder. The fact that the typical home
intruder is 95 percent
likely to be a man won’t come as a surprise to
anyone. But if you’re
looking out for a wizened professional, think again—


--- Page 92 ---
the average home
intruder is likely to be a kid.
Hot weather is notorious for causing an uptick in
violent crime, and the
same goes for nonviolent break-ins. Increased traffic
to backyard grilling
or recreation areas may lead to accidental lapses in
security, creating a
perfect target for intruders on the prowl. The same
goes for open windows
--- Page 90 ---
on ground floors.
Front and back doors are the preferred methods of
entry for 56 percent
of home intruders, so be sure to fortify doorways and
locks on all exterior
access points (see page 106). Securing a deadbolt
strike plate and door
frame with two-inch wood screws will make it more
difficult for intruders
to kick down a door. Make sure your deadbolt extends
all the way into the
strike plate. An improperly installed deadbolt, a
common issue in new or
haphazard construction, allows an intruder to bypass
--- Page 90 ---
the lock by
shimmying a knife around the bolt.
Though only 37 percent of break-ins occur after
nightfall, these have the
highest likelihood of being motivated by the will to
cause violence—so
investing in an inexpensive form of exterior night
lighting is essential.
Remove or tie-off the garage door opener cable that
allows you to
manually release the door from the inside of the
garage. Using a tool as


--- Page 93 ---
simple as a wire hanger, an intruder could easily
access the garage—and if
that garage is connected to your home, he’ll now have
an enclosed space
from which to work on gaining entry.
--- Page 128 ---
--- Page 129 ---
047  Build a Tactical Nightstand
Why waste the space on a stack of half-read books and
periodicals, when
you could turn your nightstand into a tactical
--- Page 91 ---
toolbox? Members of the
military and security personnel rarely turn in for a
night’s sleep without
having their kit at the ready—and the principle of
constant readiness by
which they abide can be adopted by the average
civilian with an interest in
safeguarding his or her home (and the people and
things inside). If the
middle of the night is the time when we are most
vulnerable to the most
dangerous kinds of attack, it stands to reason that
we’d want to stash a
--- Page 91 ---
portable armory within reach of our beds.
The top of your nightstand can be loaded with
innocuous-looking items
such as a cell phone and/or wearable device with
which to place emergency
calls and send distress signals. A candle can light a
room in the event of a
power outage. And a mouthpiece and steel-barreled pen
can respectively be
deployed as safeguard and weapon during hand-to-hand
combat. Given
that each of these items is commonly seen on bedside


--- Page 94 ---
surfaces, the totality
will not arouse suspicion. Improvise at will.
Usually an unkempt tangle of rarely used items, the
nightstand’s drawer
can be turned into a well-organized arsenal of
weapons, ranging from the
very lethal (a gun and/or fixed-blade knife) to the
nonlethal (hornet or
pepper spray and a heavy-duty flashlight, equally
useful for bludgeoning
an opponent and searching your home).
In the space between the nightstand and your bed and/
--- Page 92 ---
or the wall, stash
oversize weapons, emergency response tools, and
protective gear, such as a
baseball bat, a fire extinguisher, and a set of body
armor. While the last
may seem like overkill, any situation that requires
you to draw your
weapon is a solid contender for the use of body
armor.
--- Page 130 ---
--- Page 131 ---
048  Use a Flashlight as a Tactical Tool
--- Page 92 ---
It goes without saying that no home or apartment
should be without a
working flashlight. But many civilians don’t realize
the possibilities lying
latent in the little-used tool they’ve stashed away
in their closets. Beyond
its necessity during power outages, a flashlight can
also come in handy
during nighttime home invasions, as a means of
searching the premises,
signaling for help, and distracting or disabling an
opponent, particularly if


--- Page 95 ---
it is a heavy model made of steel and aluminum.
Perform a Tactical Search: Hear an unfamiliar sound
go bump in the
night? A flashlight becomes the optimal illumination
tool during a tactical
search of your home (see page 122). Shine a beam up
at the ceiling to
illuminate a room, and use the cover of darkness and
your knowledge of
your home’s blueprint to your advantage in order to
deceive your
opponent.
Signal for Help: If you are trapped inside your home
--- Page 93 ---
with an intruder
and no means of escape, illuminate neighbors’
bedrooms and passing cars
to signal for help. Got a dog lying out in the yard?
Shining a light in his
eyes may cause him to wake up and bark, turning your
friendly canine into
a safety whistle.
Blind or Strike an Opponent: In a direct
confrontation with an intruder,
use the flashlight to temporarily blind your
opponent. The photoreceptors
the human eye uses in low light take longer to adapt
to changes in
brightness than do those used for day vision. If the
--- Page 93 ---
eye is suddenly and
momentarily exposed to an unnaturally bright light
source, temporary
blindness is the result. Use that window to escape—or
to strike. A heavy-
duty flashlight can also be used to physically
disable your opponent.
--- Page 132 ---


--- Page 96 ---
--- Page 133 ---
049  Build an Improvised Concealable Rifle
Rack
Handy storage solutions for long, unwieldy weapons,
wall-mounted rifle
racks provide ease of access and create eye-catching
displays. They’re also
visible to anyone who enters your home or peers in
through a window, and
given that many weapons used in acts of workplace
violence and
homegrown terror are stolen, weapon theft is a real
concern. But hide your
weapon too far away, and you’re compromising your own
--- Page 94 ---
ease-of-access
in a home invasion scenario.
The standard hacks used by civilians wary of home
intrusion—placing a
rifle under the bed or mattress, or behind a
headboard—may place the
weapon in close proximity to sleeping heads of
household, but do not
facilitate a quick draw. Fortunately, a quick-to-
assemble but surprisingly
dependable solution can be jerry-rigged from two
ordinary hangers
jammed beneath a mattress, making an assault or
hunting rifle as
--- Page 94 ---
accessible as a shotgun. (Shotguns do, however,
remain the preferable
choice for home safety. Unlike bullets, buckshot
won’t rip through
Sheetrock—but it will take out a home intruder.
Because each shot fired
releases a round of lead pellets, buckshot also
creates a larger blast site and


--- Page 97 ---
requires less accuracy than a single bullet.) To
construct this improvised
concealable rack, use wooden or plastic hangers with
swiveling hooks.
Cheap wire hangers will not hold the weight of the
weapon. Position the
hooks according to the length of your weapon and, if
necessary, bend the
hooks to create a custom grip. The weight of the
mattress will hold down
the rack even if you roll around at night. Drape a
blanket over the
construction for concealment.
Note: Weapons should always be securely locked away
when children are
--- Page 95 ---
present, and weapon storage must follow regional laws
applicable to your
area.
--- Page 134 ---
--- Page 135 ---
050  Survive Home Invasions
Homeowners are frequently under the mistaken
impression that if an
intruder breaches the premises in the middle of the
night, their only
options—after calling for help—are to either await
rescue or say their
prayers. In fact, there are a multitude of actions
--- Page 95 ---
that may diminish your
risk of injury, abduction, or worse, the overriding
key being preparation.
Create an Action Plan
The last thing you want to do is be forced to make
decisions during a
crisis. Plan out your decision-making process ahead
of time so that instinct


--- Page 98 ---
can take over in the midst of uncertainty, and you’ll
already be one step
ahead of a potential intruder who is counting on the
element of surprise.
Have a plan, and enact that plan to increase your
odds of survival. It’s a
simple proposition, but one by which not enough
households abide. Make
sure all members of the household are well versed in
the plan and have
practiced appropriate elements. We’re accustomed to
the idea of
emergency fire, earthquake, and tornado drills in
businesses and schools. It
stands to reason that we should enact such drills in
the home, the focal
--- Page 96 ---
point for everything and everyone we hold most
precious.
Identify and walk escape routes and rally points as a
family, running
through various potential scenarios. Will you
congregate at a neighbor’s
house or at the park around the corner? If someone is
trying to kick in the
front door, will parents come down to the children’s
room and exit
through the back door or a second-story window? Store
portable
emergency ladders in second-floor rooms, and have all
members of the
family practice using them. Create a plan for getting
off the property’s
--- Page 96 ---
perimeter as soon as possible—a backyard could easily
become a contained
area in which family members are held hostage.
While firearm storage must follow legal safety


--- Page 99 ---
standards, improvised
weapons such as baseball bats or spray bottles filled
with bleach can be
stored around the house, along with escape tools such
as Swiss army
--- Page 136 ---
knives or razor blades. You never know which room
could become the site
of a potential hostage situation.
--- Page 137 ---
--- Page 138 ---
Keep cell phones charged and reachable in the middle
of the night.
Better yet, create a full tactical nightstand in
order to prepare for
emergencies (see page 112). Always sleep with car
keys within reach. These
--- Page 97 ---
will come in handy in the event that you need to make
a quick exit—and
you can also use them to set off your car’s panic
button in order to alert
the neighbors or spook an intruder. If you have an
up-to-date home
security system, be sure you’ve loaded the
appropriate apps onto your
phone so that you can set off the alarm without
roaming the house to
reach the security console. Establish a whispered
safe word so family
members can quickly and quietly alert each other to
--- Page 97 ---
emergencies in the
dark—as well as signal in advance that you (and not
the bad guy) are the
person creeping down the hallway.
In each room, identify couches, dressers, and
bookshelves that can


--- Page 100 ---
potentially be used as barricades. These will buy you
time as you await
rescue or attempt escape.
Store food, water, and concealed weapons in safe
rooms outfitted with
deadbolts and reachable by only one means of entry.
To fortify doorways
and locks in these rooms, see page 106.
Run through the drill with family members once a year
to ensure that
the action plan is not forgotten.
--- Page 139 ---
Respond to Crisis
In the moment of crisis, keep lights off. Turning on
lights at the first sign
that something is awry, a common reflex, will only
help an intruder track
and find you faster. You and your family know the
--- Page 98 ---
blueprint of your home
better than the intruder. Leaving the lights off
keeps him at a disadvantage.
If necessary, use a flashlight to illuminate and
sweep individual rooms to
make sure you are safe (see page 122).
Call 911 and hit alarm buttons as soon as possible.
Enact your plan,
availing yourself of weapons along the way. A
flashlight has a multitude of
uses, from temporarily blinding an opponent (see page
114) to hitting him
over the head. Be alert to the latent defensive
potential of common
--- Page 98 ---
household objects. An electrical cord can be used to
detain and or subdue
(see pages 126 and 172). Kitchen knives are fair game
for slashing and


--- Page 101 ---
dashing, and any glass bottle can be brought down
with force over an
opponent’s head. Even empty-handed, you may still
find an opportunity to
bring down an armed opponent. Particularly if you are
able to team up,
you may be able to use the element of surprise to
disarm an intruder (see
page 154). But again, in the case of a home invasion,
your primary concern
should be getting yourself and loved ones to safety.
Inflict enough pain to
stun the intruder, and then escape as quickly as
possible. Unless you are
cornered and forced to fight, your aim should be to
leave the dirty work to
law enforcement officials and get yourself and your
family members to
safety as soon as possible.
--- Page 99 ---
--- Page 140 ---
051  Combat Clear Your Home
Most civilians respond to an unfamiliar nighttime
sound by flooding their
homes with light. But learn to combat clear your home
following
professional military and security protocol, and
you’ll know that leaving
the lights off preserves your advantage. Because you
know the blueprint of
your home far better than the intruder does, you’ll
be able to move about
quickly and quietly while he loudly stumbles around
in the dark.
If you do not have a weapon and suspect there is an
--- Page 99 ---
intruder in your
home, call 911 and leave the premises. Only search


--- Page 102 ---
your home with a
weapon in hand. Keep lights off as you search, using
ambient light or a
flashlight to illuminate rooms, flipping lights on,
room by room, only as
needed.
Slowly and quietly approach corners by skimming walls
with your
weapon drawn. Clear corners by “slicing the pie,” a
military technique
that enables you to quickly and safely scan a room
through a series of
sidesteps, following a semicircular pattern that
minimizes your profile.
Keeping your eyes and the barrel of your weapon
moving in the same
direction, clear each slice of the pie, moving your
eyes and the gun’s sights
from low to high.
To clear a doorway, pie as much of the room as
--- Page 100 ---
possible before
entering. Move through the doorway quickly, then
immediately veer
sideways, flattening yourself against the wall as you
clear the blind corners
directly left and right of the door. Known as “fatal
funnels,” doorways
should be cleared as quickly as possible—the logical
place for a gunman to
aim, they are frequently the site of an innocent
person’s demise.
Once you’ve cleared each room, don’t forget to clear
any obstacles,
checking the far side of couches and beds and the
underside of tables and
countertops.
--- Page 100 ---


--- Page 103 ---
--- Page 141 ---
--- Page 142 ---
052  Command and Control a Home Invader
Many gun-owning homeowners don’t think past the act
of brandishing
their weapon in the event that they catch an intruder
on their property. But
what happens next is critical. Your goal should be
not only to avoid injury
to yourself and your loved ones, but also to avoid
getting into a situation
in which you need to pull the trigger. You want to
command and control
the intruder until the authorities arrive. To do
that, you’ll need more than
just a gun.
If your body language or tone of voice betrays
insecurity or weakness,
the intruder may seize upon a perceived opportunity
to turn the tables in
his favor. Whether or not you are an aggressive
--- Page 101 ---
individual in everyday
circumstances, in this moment you must act the part.
Your verbal
commands should be violent and forceful, delivered at
a high volume and
in simple, direct language. Your tone and language
should communicate
confidence, seriousness, and a will to do harm if the
intruder does not
submit to your commands.
Do not simply hold the intruder at gunpoint. A
standing posture, with
eyes on you, gives him far too much leverage. Use
commands to force
intruder into a prone or kneeling wall position with
his eyes away from


--- Page 104 ---
you as pictured. Both of these positions will create
--- Page 101 ---
a significant handicap,
causing a serious delay in the event that the
intruder attempts to charge
you. Keeping his head turned away from you allows you
to place a 911
call or have loved ones cross the room and exit the
premises, without
giving the intruder the opportunity to catch you in a
moment of
inattention.
Note: Do not attempt to search an intruder and strip
him of his weapons
alone. Only restrain an intruder if you have others
to support you (see
page 126). Unless you have prior experience, wait for
law enforcement.
--- Page 143 ---
--- Page 144 ---
053  Create and Apply Improvised Restraints
If you have successfully apprehended a violent
--- Page 102 ---
criminal or home intruder
(see page 124), call 911 and wait for help to arrive.
Do not attempt to
restrain a potentially violent criminal unless you
are unable to call for help
or help isn’t coming anytime soon. Unless you are a
trained security
professional or have rendered the intruder completely
unconscious, you
don’t want to be in the position of restraining an
intruder on your own.
Ideally, you’ll want one person to hold a weapon and
another to apply the
restraints.
If the situation requires the application of


--- Page 105 ---
restraints, always tie an
--- Page 102 ---
intruder’s hands behind his back, knuckle to knuckle,
a position that will
make it exponentially harder for him to escape from
his bonds. Tie
restraints as tightly as possible. The intruder’s
comfort is not your concern!
Give him the smallest window of opportunity for
escape, and he will take
it—potentially harming you and your loved ones in the
process.
As far as the type of restraints, you have a variety
of options, from
handcuffs and zip ties to paracord or electrical
wire. Two to four pairs of
zip ties can be used to create interlocking sets of
cuffs and elbow restraints,
a preferential method of temporary restraint among
many law enforcement
officials. (See illustrations, pages 128–29.)
Create Adjustable Cuffs
Don’t have a pair of handcuffs or zip ties at the
--- Page 103 ---
ready? If you have a length
of twine or paracord nearby, you can use it to create
a set of self-locking
cuffs as pictured. Start by tying a two-turn Prusik
knot around your index
finger. Remove your finger, and insert the ends of
the cord into the knot.
Slip the loops around the intruder’s wrists and pull
the ends to tighten.
For an even quicker, if more brutal, way to restrain
an opponent using a
length of cord, tie his wrists together using a girth
hitch, pictured on pages
128–30. Gather both ends of the cord together and


--- Page 106 ---
loop them around your
opponent’s neck. Pull the ends until your opponent’s
hands are raised
behind his back and movement has become impossible.
Hold on to the
--- Page 103 ---
--- Page 145 ---
ends as you’re moving the intruder around, or tie
them off to the wrist
hold down below. Adapted from a restraint technique
used in highly
sensitive military operations, this method places
torque on the restrained
party’s hands, shoulders, and neck.
If you don’t have cord or zip ties, you can still
gain the upper hand over
an intruder through the use of belts or duct tape,
items commonly found in
many homes. In both cases, after you’ve securely
wrapped the wrists, loop
the end of the belt or an additional pull of tape
vertically between the
wrists, tightening and lashing the structure together
so that escape becomes
--- Page 104 ---
impossible.
Note: Do not attempt the girth hitch unless you’ve
been properly
supervised by a trained self-defense instructor, as
the maneuver can result
in accidental choking.
--- Page 146 ---
--- Page 147 ---
--- Page 148 ---
--- Page 149 ---
054  Prisoner Handling
Once you’ve apprehended an intruder and successfully
--- Page 104 ---


--- Page 107 ---
commanded him to
a prone position (see page 124), the safest course of
action is to await the
arrival of law enforcement officials. But if
responders are delayed or you
need to move to another room to make the call, you
may be in the
unfortunate position of needing to apply restraints—a
task best undertaken
with a partner who can cover the intruder while you
make your approach
(see pages 126–27). Should you have to handle a
captive on your own, the
following protocol will maximize your chances of
safely restraining your
charge.
Again, to start, the captive should be lying chest-
down in the prone
position with his head turned away and his hands
crossed behind his back
(see illustrations). Approach quietly with restraints
at the ready, using his
lack of awareness about your movements to your
advantage.
Crouch down, digging a knee and shin into his neck
--- Page 105 ---
and upper back as
you grasp his wrists. Put weight into your knee—
controlling his head and
upper body will make it very difficult for him to get
up. Creating minimum
vulnerability for you and maximum discomfort for him,
the position
allows you to quickly rise to your feet and grab your
weapon in the event
that he puts up a struggle.
If you need to move the intruder to another room or
location after he’s


--- Page 108 ---
been restrained, use the arm bar technique (see
illustrations) to control his
movements while restraining his head. Hooking your
--- Page 105 ---
forearm up through
his elbow and toward the back of his neck, grasp him
by the collar and
pull him up to a standing position, ordering him to
cooperate. Use your
arm as a leverage point to guide the prisoner in the
direction you want him
to go. This one-handed control technique leaves your
other hand free to
open doors or hold a weapon.
--- Page 150 ---
--- Page 151 ---
055  Escape a Carjacking
Often the province of desperate individuals on the
run, carjackings can
also be a starting point for express kidnappings (see
page 164), a form of
temporary abduction in which the perpetrator may
force you to drive from
ATM to ATM, performing multiple withdrawals as a
means of immediate
ransom. Whatever the perpetrator’s ultimate aim,
--- Page 106 ---
being taken hostage in
your own car is a worst-case scenario—so give up the
car or attempt
escape before allowing a hostile, armed abductor to
enter your vehicle.
Better yet, decrease your vulnerability to
carjackings from the outset by
practicing personal and situational awareness.
Use personal awareness to avoid standing out on the
road. Beware of
renting flashy cars while traveling. Select the


--- Page 109 ---
vehicle most likely to blend in
with the cars already on the road in the environment.
Employ situational awareness at all times by
--- Page 106 ---
remaining alert to potential
threats in the vicinity. Be particularly aware of
your surroundings as you
transit through volatile areas.
Be a Safe Driver
Whether you’re moving through traffic or stopped at a
light, always
maintain a car’s length between your car and the
vehicle in front of you,
leaving yourself room to make a quick getaway in case
of emergency. Do
not fall prey to the common trap of burying your nose
in your mobile
device while waiting for a red light. You risk
rendering yourself even more
vulnerable during the most critical moment of your
route—a driver zoned
out at a light is a perfect target for a carjacker
lying in wait. Pay attention
to your surroundings, particularly when you come to a
stop, and always
keep doors locked during transit.
Keep your car in drive and your doors locked while
--- Page 107 ---
using drive-through
ATMs. Drive away as soon as you receive your
withdrawal, rather than
sitting in your vehicle and counting bills. Using an
ATM puts you at a
disadvantage to begin with. The several prompts
required by the machine
will absorb your attention for an extended period of
time, making you
--- Page 152 ---


--- Page 110 ---
catnip for the seasoned criminal who prowls this
fertile ground. Reorient
yourself to your surroundings by performing rapid
situational awareness
checks between prompts of the machine. Has the man
--- Page 107 ---
loitering on the edge
of the lot moved toward you and your car? What is
going on behind you?
--- Page 153 ---
--- Page 154 ---
Fight Back
Should a carjacker manage to take you by surprise,
surrender the vehicle if
you can. But if the perpetrator orders you to slide
over into the passenger
seat or you have children in the backseat, giving up
your vehicle may put
you or your loved ones at risk.
You may feel powerless in such a scenario, but keep
in mind that the
hostile carjacker currently confronting you isn’t the
only one armed with a
deadly weapon—within moments, the car you’re driving
could be
transformed into a four-thousand-pound weapon of
self-defense. Most
drivers don’t consider the fact that the very object
--- Page 108 ---
of a violent perpetrator’s
desires could become both the getaway car that
ferries you to safety and
the deadly tool that takes that perp out of
commission.
If the perpetrator’s weapon has breached the inside
of the car, the best
option may be to raise your hands in a motion of
false surrender, then


--- Page 111 ---
violently push and trap the weapon against the
dashboard as you floor the
gas. The perpetrator isn’t likely to expect such a
response, and may either
drop the weapon or retract both hand and weapon to
--- Page 108 ---
avoid being dragged.
Drive away quickly, without concern for the usual
rules of the road.
Drivers are conditioned to think that they can’t
cross yellow lines or drive
onto curbs or medians, but in an emergency (whether a
perpetrator has
already breached the vehicle or is rapidly
approaching) all terrain becomes
drivable.
--- Page 155 ---
Practice Pedestrian Awareness
When you’re returning to your vehicle in garages or
dark parking lots, stay
off your phone and double down on your situational
awareness. Garages
and parking lots are frequent settings for both
carjackings and violent
crimes. If you see anyone suspicious prowling around
the premises or
sitting in a parked car, make a U-turn and briskly
walk back to wherever
you came from.
--- Page 109 ---
If you are caught unawares by a carjacker who demands
your keys, do
not simply hand them over. Doing so will put you
within arm’s reach of a
potentially violent criminal. Instead, toss keys away
from the nearest exit.
Ideally, the perpetrator will head toward the keys,
allowing you to run for


--- Page 112 ---
escape.
Run to the nearest obstacle or form of cover,
concrete pillars being
preferable due to their bullet-stopping density.
Keep your eye on the perpetrator as you run from
cover to cover on
your way to safety.
--- Page 109 ---
If the perpetrator heads toward you instead of going
for the keys, he
may have been intending to harm you regardless of
whether or not you
surrendered your vehicle. See pages 154, 166, and 172
for self-defense
techniques.
--- Page 156 ---
056  Access Your Locked Vehicle
Accidentally locking your keys inside your car may
not rise beyond the
level of a frustrating mishap. But if you’ve locked a
child or pet into the
vehicle, the stakes will be considerably higher.
Fortunately, particularly on older-model vehicles,
shimmying past a
door frame to reach an old-fashioned thumb puller–
style lock is easily
achievable. All you need is a single piece of string,
worked into the car
through the opening between the top of the window and
the car door
--- Page 110 ---
frame. The most difficult part of the process will be
wedging the string past
the rubberized weather seal around the top of the
frame. The older the car,
the looser the seal.
On newer vehicles, the seal will be tighter, and the
unlock mechanisms


--- Page 113 ---
less forgiving. A wire antenna or hanger curved into
a hook can be used as
a long-reach tool with the dexterity required to pick
up keys, open door
handles from the inside, or flip locks to the unlock
position. But before you
can feed a tool into the vehicle, you’ll probably
need to use a wedge to
create an opening between the door and the frame.
--- Page 110 ---
Farthest away from both hinges and the door-lock
mechanism, the
upper-right corner of a car door is its most
vulnerable spot. Use a wooden
door stop or a similarly shaped solid wedge to breach
the door frame,
forcefully pressing the thin end of the wedge down
between the door and
the frame. If you still find it difficult to gain
purchase, shimmy a soft
object, such as a shoe, into the opening to create
another gap in the rubber
weather seal.
--- Page 157 ---
--- Page 158 ---
PART V
SECURING PUBLIC SPACES
--- Page 159 ---
057  Create an Improvised Door-Closer Lock
Commonly found in schools, offices, hospitals,
restaurants, movie theaters,
--- Page 111 ---
and most forms of commercial real estate, outward
opening doors allow
for rapid mass exit in the case of emergency. But if
the emergency takes the
form of a hostile, armed intruder attempting to force
his way into the


--- Page 114 ---
building, outward opening doors present a downside in
that they cannot be
barricaded. They can, however, be jammed shut through
the use of a belt,
purse strap, or length of rope or twine.
To slow or halt a violent intruder’s progress,
collect available straps and
--- Page 111 ---
belts from the crowd. Belts or straps with buckles
should be your first
choices, as buckles can be used to create torque and
increase constriction.
Wrap belts or straps around door-closer arms on
closed doors, at the wide
end of the triangle, closest to the door. Increase
tensile strength by
wrapping straps around multiple times. Secure the
lock by wrapping straps
back through their buckles or folding ends of straps
back underneath
themselves.
Such a contraption may not present intruders with a
permanent
obstacle, but it will slow their progress, bridging
the gap between the
moment of crisis and the arrival of emergency
services.
As you secure doors, move from cover to cover until
you are out of
harm’s way or out of sight. In selecting hiding
places, try not to corner
yourself. Leave yourself with multiple outs if you
--- Page 112 ---
can. Do not splinter off
from the group. Break up into teams of two or three
or shelter as a herd.
There is strength in numbers, as you’ll see on pages
154 and 174.


--- Page 115 ---
--- Page 160 ---
--- Page 161 ---
058  Barricade Inward-Opening Doors
When an armed and violent intruder breaches the
premises of your home
or workplace, the first course of action is to
attempt escape. But if a timely
--- Page 112 ---
exit isn’t possible, proceed to a lockdown. Do not
rely on locks alone—
locks and hinges can be shot out, and doors can be
broken down. Fortify
doors and place obstacles in the intruder’s way in
order to create a
potentially lifesaving delay.
Bolt or Bar a Door: Following a trip to your local
hardware store, two
simple types of lock fortification can quickly and
easily be jerry-rigged in
advance. The first consists of four single-cylinder
thumb-turner deadbolts,
screwed into a doorway in unexpected spots. Affix
bolts in a square
pattern, just below the top and middle set of hinges
on both sides of the
door, in order to multiply the power of a door lock.
Or barricade a door
and spread the weight of a potential blow across the
door frame by barring
it with two steel round rods, affixed to the doorway,
or beside it, with
large eyelet screws. Neither method will leave a
visible footprint on the
--- Page 113 ---
outside of the door. Both should help maintain the
structural integrity of
the door even if the assailant shoots out the hinges
and the visible locks.


--- Page 116 ---
Though their effectiveness will depend on the quality
of the door, door
frame, and hardware, as well as the integrity of the
surrounding walls,
these interior locks will make kicking down the door
a much more difficult
proposition.
Wedge or Block a Door: If you didn’t think ahead, you
still have the
last-minute options of wedging or blocking a door.
Beyond doorstops, any
--- Page 113 ---
thin object that gradually thickens, from a dustpan
to a pair of extended
scissors, could be put to use as a wedge—so that the
harder the intruder
presses against the door, the tighter the wedges will
become. Moving heavy
furniture against doors can be equally effective as a
delay tactic.
--- Page 162 ---
--- Page 163 ---
059  Barricade Outward-Opening Doors
Not all outward-opening doors are outfitted with
door-closer arms, which
can easily be jammed shut through the use of belts
and straps (see page
140). But despite appearances, any outward-opening
door can be reverse-
barricaded with heavy furniture, strategically
positioned and prepped for
quick response in the event of an armed assault.
As a precautionary measure, the large bookcases or
file cabinets
--- Page 114 ---
common to many classrooms and offices can be moved to
the side of
doorways farthest away from hinges. Create an


--- Page 117 ---
attachment system by
looping a sturdy cable around the cabinet or bookcase
(see illustration).
Securely attach the cable to a secondary cable or
power cord, which in the
event of emergency will be knotted around the
doorknob to prevent entry.
Doors may also be tied to sturdy pieces of fixed
equipment such as
radiators. If a door is within reach of another
internal door (also outward-
--- Page 114 ---
opening), tie the doors together, handle-to-handle,
to secure them both.
If no furniture is available, scour the premises for
long-handled brooms,
mops, or other sticks. Combine two or three handles
together with zip ties
or duct tape, and tightly secure them to the doorknob
using several more
zip ties. Duct tape the ends of the sticks to walls,
and you’ve created an
improvised security bar that will present an intruder
with a serious
impediment to progress.
Go one step further by installing a prefabricated
barricading
mechanism, most effective when used with a lever-
style handle. Anchor an
eyelet screw onto a foundational stud in the wall
opposite the handle, then
connect to handle using a bicycle cable. When not in
use, the cable can
dangle from its carabiner.
Test all contraptions to ensure an intruder won’t be
--- Page 115 ---
able to create even a
small gap of space in the doorway.


--- Page 118 ---
--- Page 164 ---
--- Page 165 ---
060  Handle a Bomb Threat
Though the majority of bomb threats called in to
businesses and schools
are hoaxes designed to cost companies money or simply
create a sense of
mayhem, any such threat should be taken seriously and
acted on
immediately.
Threats that arrive via email or snail mail can
--- Page 115 ---
easily be bumped up the
chain of command and sent to law enforcement
authorities, but many
threats arrive by phone. If you are the recipient of
a phoned-in threat,
remain calm.
Pre-establish distress signals in the workplace so
that you can silently
alert nearby colleagues of an emergency via simple
gestures like patting
your head or holding up two fingers. This will let
your colleagues know to
call 911—while listening to your end of the
conversation in order to pick
up as many clues as possible.
Repeating and/or writing down everything the caller
says will give the
people around you access to the information in real
time. Ask questions in
order to extract as much information as possible
while stalling for extra
time until law enforcement arrives: Where is the
bomb? When will the
bomb explode? How big of a blast will the bomb cause?
--- Page 116 ---
Will it be initiated


--- Page 119 ---
on a timer, or triggered remotely? What kind of a
bomb is it? What can we
do to prevent you from initiating the blast? Pretend
not to hear the caller,
and ask the caller to repeat him-or herself in order
to further the delay.
Listen for background noises such as honking or other
voices. Make note
of the caller’s gender, accent, voice, and any other
information that might
help law enforcement.
The caller may not be willing to give up additional
information, but the
architects of terror are frequently driven by an
egomania that may result in
--- Page 116 ---
their sharing details of their trade as a result of
pride of authorship.
--- Page 166 ---
--- Page 167 ---
061  Elude Ransomware Attacks
Once the province of lone hackers working to disrupt
the status quo,
cybercrime has become a lucrative bastion of criminal
activity, ranging
from 
acts 
of 
cyberterrorism 
that 
threaten 
infrastructure 
and
communications to petty crimes used to extort small
sums of money from
innocent civilians.
The security of an organization’s firewalls offer
--- Page 117 ---


--- Page 120 ---
scant protection, as
most viral attacks are detonated by a harmless
gesture: the click of an
employee.
Ransomware attacks prey on this click, spreading a
virus that freezes up
a computer and encrypts its data. The attackers hold
your emails,
documents, and data hostage, demanding a fee for
their decryption and
release. The fee may be small when targeted at
individual office workers,
or large, in the case of data breaches that
compromise the work flow of an
entire organization.
--- Page 117 ---
Prevent ransomware attacks before you get into a
situation where you’re
left no choice but to pay. Update programs regularly
to ensure all security
loopholes are closed, and employ a 3-2-1 backup
strategy, saving
information locally, to an external hard drive, and
to a cloud-based data
storage system. Do not open suspicious emails or
click on unfamiliar links.
Be vigilant, and create bona fides such as shared
wallpaper or a
standardized signature block to use with family and
coworkers. Spammers
often infiltrate an organization by approximating
employees’ email
addresses. If an email does not refer to a known
project or thread or
sounds unlike the sender, check the address.
Misspelling a username or
approximating a domain name (e.g., substituting a
.net or .co suffix) are


--- Page 121 ---
--- Page 118 ---
common ruses.
If you do click on a suspicious link or open a phony
attachment,
immediately disconnect your computer from Wi-Fi and
unplug any
Ethernet cables, then power down. The odds are
against you, but you may
be able to halt the malware’s spread.
--- Page 168 ---
--- Page 169 ---
062  Detect an Inspired Terrorist
In times of global instability, a watchful citizenry
can make the difference
between a heroic tackle and a train car that bursts
--- Page 118 ---
into fiery flames. And a
hero’s work may start with a glance at a coworker’s
monitor.
Where mass shootings are sometimes unplanned,
emotionally driven
events, acts of inspired terrorism are always the
result of careful advance
planning and a potentially lengthy period of
ideological indoctrination.
Which means they may stand a better chance of being
detected and halted
by observant friends, family members, and colleagues.
In the aftermath of modern acts of mass violence,
investigators
frequently uncover chilling trails of evidence—not by
employing
sophisticated forensic technologies, but by combing
through social media
posts and speaking to the perpetrator’s friends,
family, and coworkers. The
evidence of impending catastrophe is generally hiding
in plain sight, and
too often overlooked. “It seemed strange at the time,


--- Page 122 ---
--- Page 119 ---
but we didn’t think
much of it” has become an overly familiar refrain.
Online Behavior
Online behavior can be a powerful indicator of
potential radicalization.
Religious and ideological propagandists have briskly
adapted to changing
times by mounting sophisticated campaigns online, and
while inspired
terrorists-in-training may experience personal
recruitment and/or build
bonds with local actors, the seeds of their
burgeoning ideologies are often
sown and harvested on the internet. Indoctrination
may begin with
innocent curiosity about the wide swath of propaganda
that is easily
--- Page 119 ---
viewable on the web, and then turn into a more
sinister brand of research
as the subject enters into direct communication with
terrorists, becoming
more and more consumed by news of distant combat
zones.
--- Page 170 ---
--- Page 171 ---
An interest in getting deeper into news accounts of
terrorism by viewing
available source materials isn’t an indicator on its
own, but when
combined with certain changes in online behavior it
could signify that
something more complex is in play. Along with the use
of encrypted
communication apps, the deletion of true-name social
media accounts may
be a clue that a colleague or friend is attempting to
go dark or camouflage


--- Page 123 ---
--- Page 120 ---
conversations that could alert the suspicions of law
enforcement.
--- Page 172 ---
Verbal and Nonverbal Cues
Ideological conversions don’t happen overnight. And
they’re not
necessarily silent. Perpetrators of violent attacks
tend to leave behind a
trail of evidence about their evolving patterns of
thought, and civilians
undergoing a sea change in their personal beliefs may
actually exhibit an
interest in discussing those changes. They may even
betray an interest in
--- Page 120 ---
trying to mobilize or radicalize those around them.
Listen to the clues
they’re providing. The voicing of violent fantasies,
support for violent
extremism, or praise for successful terrorist attacks
should never be taken
lightly. Switching from one extreme ideology to
another may provide
evidence of a potentially dangerous mental
instability and susceptibility to
influence.
Any sudden interest in or acquisition of military
weapons and gear
should be cause for concern, particularly if
accompanied by antisocial
behavior and increasing isolation from family and
friends. Any
unexplained acquisition of fertilizer, other high-
nitrate or nitrogen
products, or gunpowder should be regarded with
extreme suspicion. The
adoption of military-style training regimens and


--- Page 124 ---
shooting drills may signal
--- Page 121 ---
a sinister pattern of preparation. Exhibiting a
desire to travel to hot spots,
as well as a tendency toward unexplained or
suspicious patterns of travel,
is another indicator of a potential connection to
terror organizations
overseas.
--- Page 173 ---
Interpreting the Signs
None of these signs may be meaningful on their own.
But in the aggregate,
a 
profusion 
of 
signals 
--- Page 121 ---
should 
indeed 
be 
cause 
for 
concern.
Counterterrorism experts often refer to “the fighting
age,” the emotionally
volatile period of adolescence and young adulthood
during which
individuals ages fifteen to twenty-five are extremely
susceptible to
recruitment into violent extremism. Because
behavioral extremes are
normal during the teenage years, worrisome
preoccupations may be
difficult to detect. What distinguishes an alienated
youth from an alienated
youth who picks up a gun? The answer is much more
difficult to discern


--- Page 125 ---
than it may seem. Watch for abrupt and radical
changes in behavior.
--- Page 122 ---
Withdrawal on its own may be a typical teenage phase.
Withdrawal and a
sudden interest in explosives should most definitely
not be swept under the
rug. Alienated youths are more easily manipulated by
extremist groups and
ideologies that funnel their alienation into orderly
worldviews.
--- Page 174 ---
063  Ambush an Active Shooter
There’s a misconception among the general public that
says you need
firepower to fight firepower. The notion that even a
large group of
unarmed civilians is defenseless against a lone
shooter tends to go
--- Page 122 ---
unchallenged. But recent events have shown that one
or two motivated
bystanders do have the power to halt a potentially
deadly event before it
devolves into a mass casualty scenario. And as the
scores of convenience-
store owners who’ve resisted armed robberies can
attest, you don’t have to
be a former member of the military to save lives.
Remember, an armed
shooter is counting on your fear and passivity. The
last thing he’s
expecting to encounter is a brave and violent act of
resistance.
Tackling a Shooter from Behind
A body mass equal to or greater than the shooter’s
can only be helpful
when it comes to an aggressive self-defense maneuver,


--- Page 126 ---
but it isn’t essential.
Using the elements of speed, surprise, and technique,
any adult, male or
--- Page 123 ---
female, can take a violent aggressor to the ground.
Similarly,
outnumbering the shooter or shooters by organizing
into teams of two or
three is ideal, for a gun can only be shot in a
single direction at once. But
even a lone resistor can neutralize an armed
assailant.
If you’re on your own and have the opportunity to
tackle a shooter
from behind, use momentum and proper form to take him
to the ground
(see illustration). You don’t need a running start,
but you absolutely do
want to be aggressive in your approach. Put your
shoulder into the small
of his back and thrust your weight forward,
simultaneously encircling your
arms around his pelvis and violently pulling back.
--- Page 123 ---
Bring your back leg
forward and use it to trip the shooter so that you
both fall forward. Once
you’ve got him on the ground, trap the weapon and use
the weight of your
pelvis to pin the shooter down. If you’ve got a free
hand, throw an elbow
at the back of his head, or just apply pressure to
prevent him from
regaining control. Flattened out and pinned to the
earth, even the strongest
assailants will find themselves surprisingly
helpless.
--- Page 175 ---


--- Page 127 ---
--- Page 176 ---
Tackling a Shooter Coming Through a Doorway
If you’re behind a door or around the bend of a
hallway and can hear the
--- Page 124 ---
shooter coming your way, be ready to act. Combining
the elements of
surprise and swift, violent action, your aim is to
tackle him and strip him
of his weapon before he can get victims in his
sights. Stand at the ready
with your back flat against the wall, to the side of
the hallway or on the
doorknob side of the door. The moment the shooter’s
weapon breaches the
room or rounds the corner, use both hands to grab
onto the weapon and
the shooter’s arm, then violently drive the weapon to
the ground while
dropping your body weight into a fall. Ideally,
you’ll want to wind up with
one hand on the weapon and one hand on the shooter’s
arm, dropped to
--- Page 124 ---
your knees and leaning over with the weapon pointed
to the ground. But
violent action is an inexact science. No matter the
hold, if you grab the
weapon and drop, the likelihood is that the shooter
will fall off balance
and go to the ground with you in an attempt not to
relinquish the weapon.
This moment also clears the way for others to get
involved in fully
stripping the shooter of his weapon and restraining
him.
If you’re able to work as a team, assign one person
to trap the weapon


--- Page 128 ---
and another to take the shooter’s legs off balance. A
third could go for the
head. Stand with one person on either side of a
doorway as the shooter is
approaching. If the shooter spots one of you, the
--- Page 125 ---
other will still be able to
take him by surprise. Do not assign too many people
to the initial act of
taking down the shooter, or you may get in each
other’s way.
Any number of improvised weapons may be incorporated
into these
maneuvers. With an improvised garrote at the ready
(page 172), one
person could be ready to choke out the assailant
while another goes for his
gun.
Take proper steps toward barricading and fortifying
doors (page 110)
so that taking down a shooter becomes a method of
last resort. If you’ve
successfully ambushed an active shooter, use
aggressive commands (page
124) and immobilizing restraints (page 126) to
control him until law
enforcement arrives on the scene.

PART VI:
NEUTRALIZING PUBLIC SAFETY
THREATS
--- Page 178 ---
064  Outwit a Pickpocket
While American cities have seen radical downturns in
pickpocketing in the
past few decades, smartphone theft is still a
thriving industry, slowed but


--- Page 129 ---
not eradicated by the introduction of user-operated
remote kill switches.
Globally, both wallet and smartphone theft continue
to flourish so exercise
caution by traveling light and carrying as few
valuables as possible. Be
--- Page 126 ---
particularly cautious in and around crowded areas,
known tourist
attractions, airports, and public transportation
hubs. Pickpockets and
smartphone snatchers specifically target travelers,
who tend to wander
about in a disoriented state and are likely to be
carrying some amount of
currency. Crowded areas also provide pickpockets with
plenty of
opportunities for brushing up against targets who’ve
become desensitized
to fleeting moments of physical contact in dense
crowds.
Be extremely cautious leaving cash machines and
retail checkout lines.
Both provide pickpockets with evidence that you’re
carrying cash or credit
cards, along with information about where you stash
your wallet.
--- Page 126 ---
Be alert to distracting ruses such as swarms of
begging children, overly
aggressive street vendors, and “accidental” spills
that allow pickpockets an
opportunity to get close as they helpfully offer to
clean you up. Assume the
worst upon the return of a “found” wallet,
potentially a ruse designed to
prevent you from canceling cards whose account
numbers the thief has


--- Page 130 ---
already pilfered.
Back pockets and purses are notoriously easy to
exploit (see page 160).
In high-risk areas, women should transfer their
money, cards, and
smartphone to a front pants pocket. Die-hard back-
pocket carriers can
--- Page 127 ---
construct a theft-deterrent device by slipping a comb
into their wallet (see
illustration). In the event that a thief attempts to
lift the wallet, the comb
will create a telltale snag.
Beware of unconsciously telegraphing the location of
your valuables by
palpating your pockets. Thieves are on the lookout
for this kind of highly
informative body language.
--- Page 179 ---
--- Page 180 ---
065  Counter a Purse Snatcher
Women love their purses. And so do petty thieves, who
see them as one-
stop shops for wallets, smartphones, and other
valuables.
Which is why the best form of purse-snatching
prevention is not to carry
--- Page 127 ---
a purse at all. If you must, choose a small,
nondescript model with short
straps in a common, unobtrusive shade. A luxury bag
is a particularly
strong enticement for thieves, who see it as
assurance that their heist will
be worthwhile. (Even the bag itself may be of value.)
Long straps are
vulnerable to the cut-and-snatch technique. A large
bag also makes an easy


--- Page 131 ---
target, and increases the probability that you’ll
spend time rummaging
around in search of what you need. Losing awareness
of your surroundings
for prolonged periods of time can make you catnip to
watchful predators.
Carry your purse away from the street, and skim
building facades as
--- Page 128 ---
you transit. A common heist has thieves riding by on
a moped and
disappearing with your purse before you can react, or
snatching a purse
and running away on foot. Make it more difficult for
these brazen
criminals to operate.
Tuck your purse under your arm and in front of your
body when
transiting through high-risk or densely trafficked
areas. Wear longer-
strapped bags across your body—unless you’re walking
on a dark street or
through a desolate garage where your bag could be
used as a leash in an
abduction scenario (see page 166).
Place your purse on your lap, and not on the back of
a chair or on the
ground, when dining outdoors. Wandering bands of
thieves commonly
target the terraces of European cafés.
Don’t make yourself an easy target. Walking while
--- Page 128 ---
talking on the phone
or texting, studying maps, or eating and drinking can
all make you both
more vulnerable to and less able to react to surprise
attacks.
--- Page 181 ---


--- Page 132 ---
--- Page 182 ---
066  Outsmart a Virtual Kidnapper
There’s a new scam in town, one that preys on social
media to extort cold,
hard cash. The perpetrators use details gleaned on
public posts (names,
patterns of life, relationships) to fake a
kidnapping, calling up victims with
enough information about loved ones to sow fear in
--- Page 129 ---
their hearts. At times
they have young actors screaming in the background, a
ploy that quickly
distorts the perceptions of already panicked parents.
Any kidnapping claim should be taken seriously, but
several indicators
may help you determine whether a particular threat is
real or faked. Real
kidnappers worry about their cell phones being
triangulated or their
landlines being traced. They tend to brusquely make
demands and hang
up, perhaps delivering details over a series of
calls. Virtual kidnappers
want you to stay on the line as long as possible, in
order to prevent you
from making contact with your loved one and
uncovering the hoax. Real
kidnappers may call from a loved one’s phone—a
chilling sign that
something has gone very wrong indeed. They generally
--- Page 129 ---
ask for large sums
of money, then give you some time to gather the
funds. Virtual kidnappers
ask for smaller sums and want their payment right
away, before their scam
falls apart.


--- Page 133 ---
To determine which one you’re dealing with, attempt
to reach your
loved one while on the phone with the supposed
kidnapper. Ask for proof
of life. A ream of excuses about why the kidnapper
cannot supply proof of
life is not conclusive evidence of a virtual
kidnapping, but when combined
with other signs it may be a strong indicator.
Prevent virtual kidnappings from the outset by
--- Page 130 ---
refraining from posting
travel plans or tagging your locations on social
media. Deny virtual
kidnappers access to any information they may
exploit, from the names of
your children to the location of their schools.
--- Page 183 ---
--- Page 184 ---
067  Prevent and Survive an Express
Kidnapping
A category of crime that was once mostly directed at
the very rich and
their offspring, kidnapping has diversified its
stock. Ordinary travelers
with working debit cards are now prime targets, their
ordeals lasting
anywhere from minutes to hours or days. Common to
South America,
Central America, and parts of Southeast Asia, the
crime often starts at
--- Page 130 ---
ATMs or in cars. Usually uninterested in
commandeering your vehicle, its
perpetrators are after something far easier to handle
—cold, hard cash.
Avoid falling into their clutches by keeping your
doors locked and your


--- Page 134 ---
windows closed when driving in high-risk countries.
Do not roll down
windows to speak to street vendors or strangers who
approach. Speak
loudly and you’ll be heard through glass. Only use
taxi services
recommended by local embassies and the State
Department, or use hotel
shuttles or mass transit. Exercise caution at ATMs
and avoid street-side
machines.
--- Page 131 ---
Practice the same safety measures any smart traveler
should employ—
travel light, blend in with the local population, and
refrain from wearing
flashy and/or expensive clothing or jewelry. In areas
prone to express
kidnappings, consider carrying a dummy wallet as an
extra layer of
security. Stash a small amount of cash, a single form
of identification, and
a single credit card in this wallet, leaving your
passport and other debit
cards at home or concealing them elsewhere on your
body. Express
kidnappers frequently drive their victims from ATM to
ATM, holding
them at gunpoint as they max out the machines’ daily
limits on all debit
cards. A dummy wallet will allow you to give the
appearance of
surrendering while still protecting your valuables.
Express kidnappings are becoming more and more
violent, so the
--- Page 131 ---
appearance of cooperation may not be enough to
appease your attackers.


--- Page 135 ---
If you sense that your life is in danger, attempt
escape.
--- Page 185 ---
--- Page 186 ---
068  Resist an Attempted Abduction
Do not gently acquiesce to an abductor’s will. Assume
the worst—that
unlike a thief, an abductor isn’t likely to be
satisfied until he has caused
you grave physical harm—and act accordingly. Do not
let him have his
way.
--- Page 132 ---
If you have the opportunity to place a 911 call, do
so quickly and then
place the phone on silent, hiding it on your body. If
you cannot place a
call, switch your phone to silent at the first
opportunity. Law enforcement
authorities may be able to use your device as a
tracking mechanism if you
are indeed abducted and taken to a second location.
But nothing positive can be gained from following a
violent abductor to
a location that is potentially isolated and set up
for optimal restraint, so
fight back with everything you’ve got. Be loud and
aggressive. Perpetrators
look for easy targets who won’t put up a fight, and
noise may attract the
attention of potential witnesses who’ll be able to
contact law enforcement
and provide descriptions of the perpetrator. If you
aren’t carrying Mace,
use improvised weapons such as keys, pens, purse
--- Page 132 ---
straps, or charger cords
(see page 172) to inflict harm.


--- Page 136 ---
If the abductor is brandishing a weapon or overcoming
your efforts to
fight, surrender temporarily rather than fighting to
the point where you are
rendered unconscious and completely powerless. As you
are being
restrained, take deep breaths and subtly spread
limbs, fingers, and wrists in
order to create slack and improve the odds of escape.
Present your wrists
out in front of you to diminish the odds of getting
restrained with your
hands behind your back, a far less maneuverable
--- Page 133 ---
position. Attempt escape
as soon as possible—the odds will be much better
while you’re in transit
than after you’ve been taken to a secondary location.
--- Page 187 ---
--- Page 188 ---
069  Spot a Concealed Handgun
Individuals who carry a handgun professionally are
well attuned to the
range of mannerisms that can indicate the presence of
a concealed weapon
within their vicinity. Civilians, too, can learn to
familiarize themselves with
these signs and signals. When combined with
suspicious behavior, the
suspected presence of a concealed weapon should put
bystanders on high
alert.
Body Language: People carrying handguns tend to
subconsciously
telegraph the location of the weapon via their body
--- Page 133 ---
language. They may
reflexively palpate the gun to make sure the weapon


--- Page 137 ---
is still safely in its
holster, subtly reposition the weapon prior to
sitting or standing, or shift
their weight away from nearby bystanders to avoid
accidental contact with
or theft of the weapon.
Asymmetry: Another telltale sign is asymmetry in
clothing. Guns are
heavy and bulky, and thus will betray signs of their
presence to anyone
who’s paying attention. An outside-the-waistband
holster may cause a
visible midline bulge, while an ankle holster may
cause a bulge or
--- Page 134 ---
tightening of the fabric at the lower leg. A gun held
in a jacket pocket will
weight down one side of the jacket unevenly.
Environment: Hot or inclement weather can make
concealed weapons
easier to spot. Rain, wind, or sweat can reveal the
outline of a gun, which
will generally be much easier to hide under multiple
layers of cold-weather
clothing.
Negligence: Weapons are also frequently exposed due
to temporary
negligence, flashed or inadvertently dropped as a
gunman reaches for his
wallet. Dropped weapons are an all-too-common
scenario at public
urinals, where inexperienced perpetrators may
thoughtlessly unzip their
pants—thereby releasing the tension that was holding
up the holster.
--- Page 189 ---
--- Page 134 ---
--- Page 190 ---


--- Page 138 ---
070  Spot a Suicide Bomber
Unlike shooters, who can be unarmed or neutralized
mid-carnage, suicide
bombers strike in a single, deadly blow—a
monomaniacal attack so
decisive it becomes virtually unstoppable. The only
way to fight back is to
prevent the device from ever being detonated,
disarming bombers before
they have a chance to strike. Detection is the name
of the game, which is
why airline security has become so complex. But as
several incidents have
demonstrated, you don’t need a scanner to detect a
potential threat.
--- Page 135 ---
The explosive devices that used to be packed in
bulky, heavy backpacks
are now often strapped onto the bomber’s body in belt
or vest form, but
bombers will still need to wear bulky, heavy layers
of clothing to hide the
bombs. They are likely to be exhibiting several signs
of extreme
nervousness, from profuse sweating to a zombie-like
sense of tunnel vision.
They may seem oblivious to their surroundings, moving
through a crowd
with an unusual sense of purpose that is the result
of prior reconnaissance
and a single-minded goal.
Tackling a suicide bomber is a life-threatening
proposition, as the
bomber could detonate his or her vest or belt at any
time. If you’re within
leaping distance, immediately restrain the bomber’s
hands so that he or she
cannot activate the device. Avoid touching the


--- Page 139 ---
device. Have all the people
--- Page 135 ---
around you shut down their mobile phones in order to
turn the area into a
NERF (non-electromagnetic radiation facility) or Zero
RF (zero radio
frequency) zone. Explosives and electronics do not
mix, and radio
frequencies could potentially set off a detonator.
Assume the worst—military-grade explosives with
electric blasting caps
that could be detonated by any electronic device with
Wi-Fi, cellular,
Bluetooth, or satellite capability.

071  Choke Out a Bad Guy
An often overlooked form of self-defense, choking out
a violent criminal
requires neither brawn nor expertise in mixed martial
arts. Best employed
as a covert attack on an unsuspecting assailant who’s
just entered a room,
the move benefits from the element of surprise—or
momentary inattention
on the part of an aggressor who might be busy with
other victims during a
mass shooting scenario.
The goal of the technique is to cut off circulation
from the carotid
arteries to the brain, causing the aggressor to lose
consciousness in a
matter of seconds. Slipping an improvised garrote
around an aggressor’s
neck yields a much greater probability of success
than a headlock, which
requires a significant amount of pressure and some


--- Page 140 ---
luck. An assailant may
--- Page 136 ---
be able to hold his breath for several minutes, and a
headlock sometimes
only succeeds in cutting off airflow. Using an
improvised garrote
guarantees that, with enough pressure, you’ll be
hitting both the
respiratory tract and the arteries.
All you’ll need in order to execute the technique are
two pens or pencils
and a piece of improvised wire—a single shoelace
(preferably Kevlar), the
wire from a cell-phone charger, or the Kevlar lanyard
from a retractable ID
holder. Tying overhand loops into both ends of the
wire and inserting pens
--- Page 137 ---
into the loops yield a two-handled choking system
with a grip. Without the
handles, you won’t be able to exert the necessary
amount of pressure.
Loop the wire over the assailant’s head, then pull
your hands behind his
neck to cinch the mechanism in place. Exert as much
pressure as possible,
and maintain pressure until your opponent collapses.
Consciousness will
return in under a minute, so quickly use the
advantage to run to safety.
--- Page 193 ---
--- Page 194 ---
072  Take Out a Hijacker
Today’s hijackers make yesterday’s airborne
vigilantes, with their lists of
demands and their penchant for publicity stunts, look
practically
innocuous.


--- Page 141 ---
A suicide bomber isn’t using the plane as a form of
--- Page 137 ---
political leverage,
but as an instrument of mass murder. He has no
demands that can be
immediately fulfilled, and he isn’t likely to be
talked out of his ultimate
goal—mass murder in combination with a suicidal
fantasy that promises
him untold rewards in the afterlife. Which means that
if your flight is
overtaken by hijackers, the cost of inaction will
almost certainly be death.
You certainly may risk personal injury or death by
attempting to tackle a
suicide bomber, but those outcomes are practically
guaranteed if you fail
to act. Use the following security guidelines to
--- Page 138 ---
increase the odds of a
successful intervention. Though its passengers
weren’t able to avoid a
tragic outcome, history, in cases such as United
flight 93, has shown that
passenger action may result in a reduction of carnage
at the very least.
Do Not Attempt to Act Alone: Team up with nearby
passengers, and
assign teams of two passengers to each hijacker.
Window-seated
passengers are less useful from an immediate-action
perspective, due to the
difficulty they will have accessing the aisle. Aisle-
seated passengers should
quietly plan for action with the person sitting
opposite them and the two
people sitting directly in front and behind them.
Those with military or


--- Page 142 ---
security experience should always select aisle seats
in order to be available
during a crisis.
Gather an Arsenal: Start by collecting improvised
weapons (pitchers of
--- Page 138 ---
hot coffee, rolled-up newspapers), shields (seat
cushions, tray tables), and
temporary restraints (power cords, purse straps) from
the environment.
Come Up with a Plan: Two to three aisle-seated
passengers acting in
tandem can create a box around a hijacker as he walks
by. To avoid
--- Page 195 ---
overcrowding, only two people should move into the
aisle, while the
remaining person stands directly over his or her
seat. Assign each person a
--- Page 139 ---
task. The party with primary access should pounce on
the weapon, while
the second and third parties should restrain the
hijacker’s head and body.
Control the head, and you’ve essentially got control
of the body. Get the
hijacker off balance and onto the ground as quickly
as possible, and apply
temporary restraints.
Delineate Criteria for Action: For example, you’ll
spring into action as
soon as a hijacker passes you in the aisle, but
you’ll wait if two hijackers
are patrolling the aisles together.
Reinforce Restraints: Once hijackers are restrained,
ransack the
airplane’s medical bags for medical tape and
bandages. Layer these over


--- Page 143 ---
the existing restraints to reinforce the bind.
Quarantine Hijackers: Confine hijackers to rear
lavatories, which can be
locked from the outside by flight attendants, while
you decide what to do.
Shove Them Off the Plane: If pilots and security
command forces agree
--- Page 139 ---
that the hijackers still pose an immediate threat via
the possibility of
surgically implanted explosives, they may determine
that the safest course
of action is to jettison them from the flight. After
pilots lower the plane to
ten thousand feet in order to depressurize the cabin,
lead hijackers to
emergency exit doors behind the plane’s wings. The
last thing you want is
a hijacker’s body flying straight through the engine
body as he makes his
--- Page 140 ---
final exit from the flight.

PART VII
DISASTER SURVIVAL
--- Page 200 ---
073  Escape a Tsunami
With the power to level entire cities and reshape the
course of human
history, tsunamis are among the most perilous of all
natural disasters.
Striking with little warning and causing tremendous
devastation, the
unfathomably powerful and destructive waves start
with seismic activity


--- Page 144 ---
along faults running deep under the seafloor.
--- Page 140 ---
Also sometimes caused by volcanic eruptions, the
violent, flooding
surges travel at speeds of five hundred miles per
hour before piling up
against the coastline, rising hundreds of feet into
the air, and then crashing
onto dry ground with the force of several nuclear
bombs.
Though smaller tsunamis are frequent in well-known
high-risk zones
along the coasts of the Pacific and Indian oceans,
the American Northwest
is said to be overdue for the kind of giant wave that
hasn’t been
documented in the region for more than a thousand
years, so preparation
is essential.
Evacuation routes may be marked in high-risk areas,
but don’t wait
--- Page 141 ---
until disaster strikes to acquaint yourself with
routes to high ground. If you
live near or are visiting a high-risk coastline, plan
both foot and vehicle
routes to landmasses or solid structures 150 feet
above sea level or two
miles inland. Don’t rely on vegetation to keep you
safe. Trees will likely be
swept away.
Certain regions are equipped with tsunami warning
systems based on
detection devices placed along the seafloor. In the
absence of a warning,
heed nature’s clues. Any significant earthquake felt
along the coast should
be cause for concern, as should a rapid fall or rise


--- Page 145 ---
in shorelines and
unusual behavior seen in animals. The amount of time
you will have
between the earthquake and a potential tsunami
depends on the distance of
--- Page 141 ---
the fault from the shoreline, but you will often have
no more than twenty
minutes to get to high ground. Move swiftly, for time
is of the essence.
--- Page 201 ---
--- Page 202 ---
074  Survive an Avalanche
Though occasional incidents involve mass casualties,
avalanches claim only
some 150 lives per year. But many more non-fatal
incidents go unreported.
To avoid landing in either category, abstain from
skiing, rock climbing, or
snowmobile riding on heavily powdered, backcountry
slopes that haven’t
been groomed or detonated in order to purposely
--- Page 142 ---
precipitate avalanches in
advance of human activity. Talk to locals in order to
identify known
avalanche zones and the general probability of
avalanches in the area. Pay
attention to the weather—a foot or more of fresh snow
can pose a risk
factor, as can rain.
If you are caught in the midst of an avalanche while
on a steep, barren
slope, quickly move to its flanks while you still
can. Snow will be funneled
down the center of the slope, potentially carrying
less momentum and mass
on its sidelines. If an avalanche starts below your


--- Page 146 ---
feet, jump upslope of any
crack you might be able to see in the top layer of
snow.
If you cannot avoid the oncoming rush, grab onto any
solid fixture you
--- Page 142 ---
can reach (tree, rock formation, telephone pole), or
lie down and try to
“swim” with the moving snow so that you don’t receive
the impact at a
perpendicular angle.
Being buried in snow isn’t dissimilar to being buried
in sand. You may
not be able to move or breathe once the precipitation
comes to a halt, so if
you can, create an air pocket by placing your hands
in front of your face as
you’re still moving. Determine which way is up by
sensing the direction of
the blood flow to your head or lighting a lighter, if
movement is available.
Punching an air channel from your face up toward the
surface of the snow
--- Page 143 ---
will put you closer to a full breath when a rescue
team starts digging.
--- Page 203 ---
--- Page 204 ---
075  Survive an Earthquake
Of the twenty thousand earthquakes that rock the
globe each year, about
fifteen will be major seismic events. But all too
often, even civilians who
live in earthquake-prone areas tend to take a blasé
attitude toward
preparation. Given that some of the safety protocol
has changed over the
years, a review is in order.


--- Page 147 ---
Identify Safe Zones
The outdated notion of rushing for the nearest
doorway has been around
since the nineteenth century, when the safest spots
in California’s adobe
--- Page 143 ---
clay homes were the wood-framed doorways. But
doorways won’t cover
you from projectiles, and these days most homes are
fully wood-framed.
True safe zones include sturdy pieces of furniture,
such as tables and
desks, and structurally sound spaces like the inside
corners of rooms and
interior walls.
Stay away from glass windows or surfaces.
Be Earthquake Proof
Earthquake-proof your home by latching large, heavy
pieces of furniture to
the foundation of your home.
Secure bracing wire to a ceiling joist to support
hanging light fixtures
and fans, and use earthquake-proof picture hooks and
putty to affix
--- Page 144 ---
framed art and photographs to your walls.
Large wall-hanging mirrors and televisions should be
bracketed to studs
and hung on closed hooks.
Prepare to Evacuate
In addition to the more extensive earthquake kit
commonly recommended
to residents of geologically active zones (tools, a
gallon of water per person
per day, and a week’s worth of food), a go-bag is a
worthwhile precaution.
There’s no telling what types of secondary
emergencies an earthquake


--- Page 148 ---
might create—from a collapsed foundation to floods,
fires, or violent riots
--- Page 205 ---
—so it’s best to be prepared for sudden egress.
If possible, create several iterations of the go-bag,
stashing one in your
car, one in the master bedroom, and one in the
--- Page 144 ---
kitchen or living room.
Stop and Drop
During an earthquake, follow the most widely
recommended piece of
safety protocol: Stop, drop or cover, and hold on.
Drop to the ground before the earthquake drops you.
Seek cover if possible, holding on to the object
you’re sheltering under
to prevent it from rolling away.
Do not run outside, where toppling trees and power
lines can pose grave
danger.
If you are in bed, stay there, and cover your face
with a pillow to
protect yourself from projectiles and glass. If you
are in your vehicle, stop
once you are clear of underpasses or large trees and
--- Page 145 ---
remain in your vehicle.
If you are trapped under large pieces of debris, or
have fallen down into
a basement or subterranean sinkhole, move slowly so
as to avoid causing
further structural collapse. If your go-bag is
nearby, use your whistle to
call for help. Tapping on pipes or rebar may produce
sounds loud enough
for emergency responders to hear.
In coastal areas, earthquakes may be a precursor to a
tsunami (see page


--- Page 149 ---
180), so once the shaking has stopped, get to higher
ground as quickly as
possible.
--- Page 206 ---
--- Page 207 ---
--- Page 145 ---
--- Page 208 ---
--- Page 209 ---
076  Survive a Thunder Snow Blizzard
Whether you’re caught in an old-fashioned blizzard or
a rare occurrence of
thunder snow—the combination of thunder and snow that
strikes when a
cold front moves in over a rising mass of warm, humid
air—there’s
nothing novel about the types of precautions most
likely to ensure your
safety.
Winterize Your Home and Vehicle
In regions where extreme winter weather conditions
are common, be
prepared. Stock your house and closets with rock
salt, sand, shovels,
wood, and weather-appropriate gear. Stash emergency
blankets, a wool
hat, and pocket heaters in the trunk of your car.
--- Page 146 ---
Have your car winterized, making sure your mechanic
checks your
exhaust system for leaks and crimped pipes. Your
mechanic should also
replace air filters; check brakes for wear and fluid
levels; install good
winter tires with adequate tread; check oil; ensure
the heater, defroster,
and thermostat are working properly; check
antifreeze; clean and check the
battery and ignition system; replace worn-out


--- Page 150 ---
windshield wipers; and
assess all lights.
Know When to Go
To avoid getting stranded on the road, err on the
side of caution when
making the decision to drive in a blizzard. Avoid
driving on unplowed
--- Page 146 ---
roads. If conditions look questionable, they probably
are. A vehicular
death caused by driving in low-visibility conditions
is most often a death
that would have been preventable through the use of
one simple tool:
human judgment. If conditions rapidly worsen while
you’re already on the
road, don’t feel the need to soldier through. Though
emergency conditions
set off a kind of fight-or-flight response that
launches drivers into frenzied
attempts to drive through or away from storms,
sometimes the safest
course of action is to do nothing—i.e., pull over and
wait out the storm.
--- Page 210 ---
Wait Out a Storm
If you do become stranded in a remote area, do not
--- Page 147 ---
attempt to hike your
way to safety unless you know the area well and have
on appropriate
clothing (see page 41 for more on cold-weather gear).
Remain in your car.
Blizzard conditions will severely reduce visibility
and increase the chances
of your getting lost while being completely exposed
to the elements.
To avoid the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and


--- Page 151 ---
conserve your
battery, only run your engine and heater for ten
minutes of every hour. If
you aren’t traveling with a trunkful of warm layers
and/or blankets, stack
seat covers and floor mats on top of you as
insulation. At night, leave the
dome light on so that your car is visible to other
drivers. Hazard lights will
--- Page 147 ---
burn up your battery.
In the event that you feel the signs of hypothermia
beginning to set in,
use your stash of emergency pocket heaters to warm up
your core (see page
150); if your body temperature has dropped past a
certain point, warming
your fingers or feet first could cause a dangerous
rush of blood to the
heart.
--- Page 211 ---
--- Page 212 ---
--- Page 213 ---
--- Page 214 ---
077  Survive Tornadoes and Hurricanes
No natural disaster strikes more fear in the heart of
the average civilian
than the threat of an impending hurricane, touted for
--- Page 148 ---
days if not weeks in
advance by weather forecasters as a potentially
cataclysmic event. But
while history has shown the importance of heeding
hurricane evacuation
warnings, the unannounced danger posed by tornadoes
tends to have even
deadlier ramifications.
The world may face ten hurricanes in any given year,


--- Page 152 ---
but the U.S. alone
sees upward of a thousand tornadoes—the American
Midwest famously
being the world leader in the violent weather system.
And while severe
--- Page 148 ---
hurricanes can create mass casualty scenarios, on
average tornadoes claim
more lives, their deceptively smaller radius
camouflaging their sudden
powers of destruction. They are the lone wolves of
the weather systems.
Heed Evacuation Warnings
The principal danger with hurricanes is not wind but
flooding, making
timely evacuation crucial. Residents of high-risk
areas may take a casual
attitude to such warnings after years of false
alarms, but they shouldn’t—
for it only takes one big flood to sweep away an
entire city’s infrastructure.
In the event of a tornado, there may be very little
time to react, which is
why the fast and violent winds tend to claim more
lives. Where hurricanes
are easily spottable by satellite as they gather
their strength over oceans,
tornadoes can form in minutes, given the right
atmospheric conditions.
--- Page 149 ---
Contrary to popular belief, they are not always
visible, and their path of
destruction may spread for more than a mile beyond
their cyclical funnel.
Follow the Right Protocol for Your Location
Your location will determine the best safety protocol
in response to a
tornado. In addition to standard preparedness


--- Page 153 ---
supplies, be sure to include
a wrench and pliers in your go-bag so that you can
safely shut off gas and
water valves in the event of leakage.
--- Page 215 ---
Know When to Shelter in Place: Do not attempt to
shelter in a mobile
--- Page 149 ---
or prefabricated home. Unless your home is safely
bolted to the ground,
you risk severe harm by staying in place. Find a
solid structure and hunker
down.
Go Low, Go Central: Staying away from windows and
doors, make your
way to the centermost and lowest point in the
building. Keep doors and
windows closed. The outdated practice of opening
windows to avoid a
pressure vacuum can result in strong winds lifting
the roof clear off a
home’s foundation.
Strap In: If you are outdoors, sheltering inside a
car may be your safest
bet. Vehicle glass is built for impact, unlike
household windowpanes. Strap
on a seat belt in case the car is thrown by the force
of the tornado.
Do Not Attempt to Outrun a Tornado: A tornado has
unlimited
--- Page 150 ---
energy—you do not. It also has an unpredictable path.
Use what time you
have to hunker down as safely as possible. Seek low
ground, lying down
against ditches or depressions that may provide some
measure of
protection against projectiles.


--- Page 154 ---
--- Page 216 ---
--- Page 217 ---
--- Page 218 ---
--- Page 150 ---
--- Page 219 ---
078  Survive a Sinkhole Fall
There are many reasons civilians should be more open
to carrying a whistle
as part of their EDC. The risk of being trapped under
huge chunks of aging
infrastructure, without the ability to signal to
potential rescuers, is just
one.
There’s no such thing as solid ground in an urban
landscape, where the
apparently rock-solid pavement we drive across and
stack skyscrapers over
is somewhat of an illusion. For beneath that topmost
layer lies an entire
network of underground transportation, water mains,
and sewage lines.
In reality, there are vast pockets of open space
beneath our feet. And if
we apply too much pressure to the surface, or an
aging infrastructure
causes a water main or sewage line to rupture, vast
and gaping sinkholes
can be the result.
There’s no way for civilians to anticipate such an
occurence, and when
solid ground gives way beneath your feet, there’s
--- Page 151 ---
nothing to do but fall.
The real question is how to survive.
If you are driving, do not attempt to exit until your
vehicle comes to a
halt—cars are built to withstand impact, so you may
stand a better chance


--- Page 155 ---
of survival by remaining strapped in. To learn how to
escape a car whose
doors are jammed shut, see page 198.
If you are sucked into a sinkhole while on foot,
practice a parachute
landing fall (PLF) to protect your bones. Squeezing
your arms and legs
--- Page 151 ---
together along the midline as pictured, bend your
knees. Upon impact, fall
to the side, so that the impact is sequentially
distributed along your joints
and spine, from the ankle through the knee and hip.
Roll backward.
Landing with straight body positioning and joints
risks breaking the feet
and harming the spine.
--- Page 220 ---
--- Page 221 ---
079  Escape a Flooding Vehicle
Rule of the road: Never attempt to drive through
flooding waters high
enough to enter your vehicle’s tailpipe. Doing so
could potentially flood
the engine, causing you to stall and inflicting
serious damage on your
vehicle.
In the event that you are swept into flooding waters
and have enough
time to react, prepare to exit your vehicle by
opening windows and
unlocking doors. Though the electrical function on
--- Page 152 ---
automatic windows
and locks will still function when the vehicle is
submerged, the pressure
differential may keep windows and doors jammed shut.
Car doors may be


--- Page 156 ---
impossible to open underwater until the interior of
the vehicle is fully
flooded, so prepare for escape while you still can.
Safety protocol indicates that seat belts should be
left buckled until the
vehicle comes to a full stop, but a particular
situation may dictate
--- Page 152 ---
otherwise. Keep a knife or razor blade in a closed
compartment inside the
vehicle in order to cut yourself free should the seat
belt lock, a real
possibility if you are stuck upside-down and the
weight of your body jams
the closure mechanism.
Do not attempt to break through your car’s
windshield, as it’s double-
paned and designed to withstand impact. Kick out a
side window instead,
aiming for the top of the glass, away from the
anchors that bolt the pane
down into the door.
Car windows can be difficult to break. Jamming a
headrest spoke or
knife down between the glass and the door may create
a fulcrum that
causes the pane to shatter. If you have an emergency
glass punch tool, aim
it at the corners of the glass.
--- Page 222 ---
--- Page 223 ---
080  Walk Away from a Runaway Train
We may think of tragic derailments as the province of
--- Page 153 ---
subpar rail systems
in undeveloped countries, but recent history has
proven otherwise. Train
accidents are often the result of human error, and


--- Page 157 ---
even a momentary lapse
in attention has the potential to catapult a fully
functioning rail system into
fiery disarray.
A lack of passenger seat belts is disturbingly common
among all
modalities of public transportation—rail, bus, and
--- Page 153 ---
underground metro—in
most parts of the world. But given how instrumental
these simple devices
are in saving lives, the survival-minded civilian
would be well advised to
BYO belt. On airplanes, seat belts make the
difference between passengers
who survive serious turbulence without injury and
those who exit the
aircraft with broken bones or worse. (In at least one
documented instance,
the lone fatality of a plane crash was the single
passenger not wearing a
seat belt.)
Prep Your DIY Seat Belt
Using only a carabiner or two and either a length of
one-inch tubular
nylon cord, a purse or messenger bag strap, or a tie-
down strap (also
known as a cargo strap), a passenger can easily
create a lifesaving seat belt
in a matter of seconds (see illustrations). Attaching
the strap to a carabiner
using a waterman knot will create an adjustable, non-
slipping loop that
will allow the belt or cord to be used as a tether.
--- Page 154 ---
The safest way to travel is to strap yourself into a
seat, an immovable
anchor that will prevent you from becoming a human


--- Page 158 ---
projectile upon
impact. But if a seat is not available, you can still
increase your
survivability by strapping yourself to a balancing
pole. Attaching yourself
to a hard metal surface may sound less than
desirable, but any injuries you
may suffer as a result are likely to pale compared to
the potential for being
ejected out of the compartment upon impact. As the
saying goes, when it
--- Page 154 ---
comes to vehicular accidents, it’s not the speed that
kills you, it’s the
--- Page 224 ---
sudden stop—the moment when the vehicle comes to a
halt and your body
continues at the former speed of transit.
Single-point Anchor: To execute a single-point
anchor, simply girth-hitch
the belt or strap to the pole, attaching the
carabiner to your belt buckle or
purse strap.
Single Anchor: To create a seated lap belt around a
single anchor, hook
or girth-hitch the belt to the hardware beneath your
seat on either side of
your body, creating a semicircle around your legs. If
there is no secondary
anchor point available, it may be possible for you to
hook the belt back
onto itself in a full circle around your legs and the
seat.
Double Anchor: To create a seated chest belt around a
double anchor,
--- Page 155 ---
hook or girth-hitch a belt to the hardware beneath
the seat on one side of


--- Page 159 ---
your body, and above the seat, to the handhold over
your opposing
shoulder, on the other.
Configurations will vary depending on the particular
vehicle. Modify
accordingly.
Bringing a DIY seat belt to a public transportation
scenario may seem
absurd. But when you consider survival a possible
upside, a few curious
glances from fellow passengers may be worth the
trade-off. And who
knows—you may inspire other passengers to belt up for
--- Page 155 ---
a safer ride
themselves.
--- Page 225 ---
--- Page 226 ---
--- Page 227 ---
--- Page 228 ---
081  Escape a Skyscraper Fire
Denizens of corporate America tend to grumble through
fire drills with
barely disguised contempt, anxious to return to their
desks and get on with
their days. But the reality is that these drills,
considered a nuisance by
most, represent only a fraction of the preparation
office workers should
endure. From bolt bags to evacuation routes to
emergency protocol, there
is more to fire preparation than what is currently
served up.
Build a Bolt Bag: A baseline requirement furnished by
too few offices is
an emergency bolt bag distributed to one of every
--- Page 156 ---
five employees. Contents


--- Page 160 ---
should include food and water, but also visibility
and signaling essentials
such as flashlights, Sharpies, ChemLights, and
whistles, along with several
dust masks.
Know Your Escape Routes: Be diligent about memorizing
the location
of primary and secondary fire escapes on your floor.
Ordinary stairwells,
--- Page 156 ---
though preferable to elevators, aren’t built to code
and may be larded with
flammable materials. Elevators are generally designed
to drop to the first
floor and then disengage once a building’s fire alarm
or sensor is activated,
but they should be avoided at all costs. The hot
metal boxes can become
death traps during a fire, whether they’re stuck and
slowly baking their
passengers or depositing them straight onto a ground
floor that’s
completely ablaze. Devoid of flammable materials,
fire stairwells are also
ventilated and pressurized to keep out smoke-filled
air.
Take a close look at evacuation routes, snapping a
photograph so
they’re stored on your phone. In the event of an
emergency, know that you
may have to be flexible. If fire blocks your path to
exit, you may have to
zigzag across floors and down the building in order
to get to safety.
Be a Force for Good: Team up with others as you exit.
The more eyes,
ears, and brains on deck, the better.
--- Page 157 ---


--- Page 161 ---
--- Page 229 ---
Mark your movements as you travel, so that first
responders and other
emergency evacuees can follow your path. Designate
one or two members
of your group to mark your path with Sharpies,
ChemLights, or Post-it
notes. Assume others may be crawling through smoke,
so place markings
knee-height or lower.
And remember: Calm is just as contagious as panic. Be
--- Page 157 ---
a viral agent for
good.
Use Available Supplies: If you have no choice but to
travel through fire,
avail yourself of a corporate building’s ready water
supply. Should you
have access to one of the fire hoses on your floor,
use it to clear a path. Or
head to the nearest bathroom, remove heat conducting
jewelry, accessories,
and electronics, and completely soak your clothing
and hair in water. Roll
down sleeves and button up collars to obtain as much
coverage as possible.
Cover head, face, and hair with a wet cloth and a
dust mask.
Whenever you encounter a door, check for heat
conduction before
opening. A very hot door signals the strong
possibility of a hallway
engulfed in flames.

082  Escape Social Unrest and Riots


--- Page 162 ---
--- Page 158 ---
Banned by repressive governments, yet condoned as a
fundamental pillar
of democracy, protests can turn into chaotic, violent
events wherever they
take place—even if they start out peaceful. A tiny
band of picketers isn’t
--- Page 158 ---
likely to be cause for concern, but when emotionally
volatile groups of
people gather in large numbers, acts of violence may
be the result. Whether
you’re a willing participant, an observer, or a
passerby inadvertently swept
up in the crowd, keep an eye on crowd dynamics at all
times. A peaceful
protest may be hiding pockets of violence at its
center.
De-escalating mass violence is very difficult,
because aggression tends to
spread contagiously in an already agitated crowd. The
safest course of
action is to bypass violent crowds altogether and
identify points of
potential danger before they erupt. Avoid the space
between groups of
protesters with opposing beliefs, the front lines of
protests, areas where
protesters are massed against barricades, or dividing
lines between
protestors and law enforcement.
If you are unwittingly caught in a violent protest or
riot, think twice
before turning to law enforcement for help. Law
enforcement officials will
be in defensive mode and may reflexively lash out at
anyone who
approaches. Instead, move to the periphery of the
crowd. Seek shelter


--- Page 163 ---
--- Page 159 ---
inside or on the backside of buildings. Get to
elevated ground. Skirt a large
crowd rather than attempting to cross it.
Journalists covering volatile protests should aim to
blend in with crowds
and seek out safe havens in which women and peaceful
protesters
congregate to keep each other safe. Flow with the
crowd rather than
--- Page 159 ---
walking against the grain. Avoid the center of the
crowd, where chaos
tends to accumulate and violence can go undetected.
Exercise caution and vigilance at any large
gathering, as sizable crowds
have increasingly become a favorite target of
terrorists and lone wolves.
--- Page 234 ---
--- Page 235 ---
083  Survive a Pandemic
As we’re slowly starting to learn, the medical
advances of the past few
centuries may have lulled us into a false sense of
complacency regarding
our vulnerability to communicable disease. The
widespread use of
antibiotics in our medical and food systems, along
with the porosity of our
modern world’s international borders, have
contributed to the rise of a
class of superviruses and drug-resistant pathogens
with the ability to travel
faster than they can be contained. Though we may
think we live in a
modern society in which it’s no longer possible to
perish from a case of the
flu, recent outbreaks have shown that belief to be
anything but true.


--- Page 164 ---
--- Page 160 ---
Of course, it’s near impossible to imagine epidemics
on the scale of
those from the past, like the outbreak of Spanish
influenza that killed forty
million people in 1918. The most widely publicized
recent viral outbreak,
Ebola, took somewhere in the neighborhood of ten
thousand lives. But
--- Page 160 ---
unknown new variants that emerge before a vaccine is
created can hamper
the containment abilities of even the most medically
advanced facilities.
In the case of a true pandemic, avoiding public
spaces will be the safest
way to limit your exposure. In the early days of an
outbreak,
misinformation about communicability is common. Stock
up on food and
water supplies before shelves are stripped bare, and
wash hands religiously
before eating and after any expedition or contact
outside the household.
Steer clear of public bathrooms, particularly those
equipped with hand
dryers—these supposedly hygienic contraptions have
been shown to send
germs ricocheting through the air.
If surgical and dust mask supplies are depleted at
the first news of an
outbreak, silk ties and scarves may be used as
reasonable substitutes. The
finely woven material has the ability to filter out
foreign particles, but in a
pinch you can also use any piece of cloth that has
been doused with clean
filtered water.


--- Page 165 ---
--- Page 236 ---
--- Page 161 ---
--- Page 237 ---
084  Survive a Human Stampede
The stuff of nightmares, human stampedes can happen
anywhere from
emotionally charged sporting events to peaceful
religious pilgrimages.
When crowd control is overwhelmed, crushing injuries
--- Page 161 ---
that lead to fatal
suffocation can be the unfortunate result.
If you are caught in an evolving stampede, do not let
feelings of panic
cause you to lose control over your personal space.
Widen your stance and
keep your knees bent to ground your weight. Travel
via shuffle step,
shifting weight by dragging your feet in order to
minimize the amount of
time spent on one leg. Avoid getting pushed to the
ground at all costs—it
will be very difficult to get back up again once
you’re pushed beneath a
rushing tide of panicked people. Keep your arms up in
fighting stance, not
so that you can punch people, but to create a shield.
This defensive posture
will protect your head and chest from crushing injury
while preserving a
bubble of space in which you can breathe.
While the rest of the horde beelines for the exit,
seek out and exploit
gaps in the crowd. Others may be so single-minded in
their quest for
release that they fail to notice pockets of breathing
room around them.
Move from gap to gap. Keep moving. Do not attempt to


--- Page 166 ---
stand your
ground. The rush of bodies will make it very
--- Page 162 ---
difficult to stay on your feet.
Avoid barricades and walls, solid surfaces without
give. Better to be
crushed against a human body, which at least contains
soft tissue.
If, despite your efforts to stay upright, you are
pushed to the ground,
immediately assume the tornado position—knees bent,
spine curved over,
hands clasped behind neck and elbows tucked in. You
--- Page 162 ---
will be protecting
your head and neck and carving out breathing space. A
completely prone
body is far too easy to step on.
--- Page 238 ---
--- Page 239 ---
085  Escape a Stadium or Theater Shooting
Characterized by high fatality and injury rates,
shootings in crowded,
contained public spaces are volatile and extremely
dangerous. A density of
targets, the potential for bottlenecks, and a lack of
clarity about emergency
response protocol create a ripe environment for one
or more armed
aggressors to do serious harm. As with all crisis
scenarios, survival depends
partly on preparation and response—and partly on dumb
luck. The level of
security in any given public space is not under your
control, but you are
the sole owner of your personal preparation and
response.
Identify Exits and Choke Points


--- Page 167 ---
Take note of standard and emergency exits in any
public space. But also
consider unconventional exit paths such as stadium
--- Page 163 ---
balconies. Dropping
down to a seating area or walkway below yours may
result in injury, but
could be worth the risk if standard pathways have
become target points for
the shooter’s rifle sights.
Rather than instinctually following the herd,
identify potential choke
points and think through alternative pathways in
--- Page 163 ---
advance of a crisis
scenario so that you’re able to decisively execute an
exit plan without
excess forethought when emergency strikes. But look
before you jump—do
not attempt to exit from stadium high points. And hit
the deck before you
move, dropping down to a crouch at the first sign of
gunfire and
identifying the shooter’s direction before
proceeding. The fight-or-flight
instinct may cause those around you to blindly run
when the first shots are
fired, but the proper response is to get low as
quickly as possible.
Seek Cover and Crawl to Safety
Locate the shooter in the room or stadium before you
attempt to run to
safety. The last thing you want to do is accidentally
run in the shooter’s
direction. Do not blindly head for the emergency
exits. Shooters may have
snuck into theaters through improperly closed
emergency exit doors.


--- Page 168 ---
--- Page 240 ---
Use available materials, furnishings, and structures
as protection. Due to
the fact that movie theater and stadium seating rows
--- Page 164 ---
are built out of
concrete, chairs may provide both concealment and a
lifesaving form of
cover, depending on the angle of the shooter. Stay
low as you crawl
between seat rows. Keep your eyes on the shooter at
all times, adjusting
your path depending on his whereabouts.
Listen and Watch
Take advantage of lulls in gunfire, when the shooter
--- Page 164 ---
may be changing
magazines, to gain serious ground toward exiting. If
the shooter is within
arm’s reach, use such a lull to attempt to take him
down (see page 149).
Do not box yourself in by hiding in a dead-end zone
such as a bathroom
stall. The best choice for a contained space is one
with a solid door that
can be barricaded (see pages 141–45).
Playing dead may or may not have some chance of
success, but
prioritize escape or tackling the shooter (see page
154) over surrender. Be
brave, be bold, be violent.
--- Page 241 ---
--- Page 242 ---
--- Page 243 ---
--- Page 244 ---
086  Survive an Inspired Terrorism Attack
A climate of severe global instability indicates that
acts of terrorism and


--- Page 169 ---
their copycat offspring aren’t going anywhere anytime
soon. But whether
an attempted mass shooting is inspired by the
propaganda of an organized
group or the disturbed fantasies of a lone
--- Page 165 ---
individual, the results tend to
look much the same. At least within the U.S., these
acts of violence still
tend to center around gunfire rather than suicide
vests or pipe bombs.
--- Page 165 ---
Your response to any sign of gunfire should begin
with hitting the deck.
“Run, hide, fight” is the order of operations for
civilians caught in a cross
fire, running being the first option, and fighting
the last. But before you
run, drop and take cover. Squat or move to hands and
knees rather than
lying down, as most ricocheting bullets follow the
path of the floor. So that
you don’t accidentally run toward live fire, do not
attempt to escape before
you’ve established the direction of the shooter.
When you do escape, run from cover to cover. Choose
sources of cover
over concealment when hiding. Cover consists of
materials that stop or
slow bullets—concrete, steel, dense wood, and
granite. Concealment
options such as curtains, Sheetrock walls, or
aluminum trash cans won’t
stop bullets, but might help you escape the notice of
an assailant who’s
revved up on adrenaline and psychotic delusions. When
running through
areas with no sources of cover, travel in a zigzag


--- Page 170 ---
pattern to create a
challenge for a shooter who is likely to be
inexperienced.
If you’re hiding in a confined space, lock down and
barricade doors (see
pages 142 and 144). Steer clear of the line of the
--- Page 166 ---
doorway, the “fatal
funnel” through which the majority of bullets fly.
If all else fails, fight. Team up, grab improvised
weapons, and assign
tasks. Fight with extreme violence and aggression.
Your life depends on it.
--- Page 166 ---
--- Page 245 ---
--- Page 246 ---
087  Survive Long-term Captivity
Long-term solitary confinement in a windowless
subterranean warren, far
outside the reach of law enforcement or rescue, would
be enough to make
most human beings crack. Yet survivors of prolonged
episodes of captivity
report monumental and sometimes surprisingly
successful efforts at
preserving their mental acuity and psychological
equilibrium under even
the most unimaginable conditions. Though most
captives assume they are
completely powerless, a combination of internal
habits of mind and
external behaviors can improve both their
survivability and their odds of
escape.
Despite the complex and dark matrix of feelings
captors will inspire,
they become the other half of a captive’s primary
relationship during


--- Page 171 ---
captivity—a relationship the smartest of captives
learn to nurture and
manipulate. Establish a rapport with captors over
time, developing
individual bonds with the most sympathetic among
them. Use small talk to
extract information about the outside world and to
--- Page 167 ---
humanize yourself to
captors—while making the most of your limited access
to social contact,
an essential component of psychological stability.
And remember: Your
captor is human, too. You’re both going through the
same ordeal, though
--- Page 167 ---
you may be on different sides of the bars. The more
quickly you can
humanize yourself to the person on the outside, the
better chance you’ll
have of cultivating an asset who’ll advocate on your
behalf for basic
survival needs and improvements in quality of life.
But be very strategic
about when and how you ask for favors. You are
engaged in a mental
game of chess, using your dependence to create a
sense of responsibility
without arousing suspicion or the sense that your
captor is being taken
advantage of.
Captors from other cultures may hold long-entrenched
beliefs about the
inferiority of captives, who may be seen as dogs,
heathens, intrinsically
evil, and essentially subhuman creatures. Wild or
erratic behavior will only
confirm their prejudices. Regardless of poor


--- Page 172 ---
treatment on their part, do
--- Page 247 ---
your best to maintain a polite and collected external
facade. A crying,
whimpering, or outwardly angry prisoner becomes a
prisoner who is all
too easy to neglect or ignore, where a prisoner who
gratefully accepts food
--- Page 168 ---
is one who is more likely to be regularly fed.
--- Page 248 ---
--- Page 249 ---
Do not fall into the trap of assuming your captivity
--- Page 168 ---
will end in either
rescue or death, a mindset that makes it all too easy
to slip into passivity
while ignoring the third option, escape. Staying
physically and mentally
active will both improve your odds of survival and
make it more likely that
you will be able to seize the opportunity for escape
when it arises.
And arise it will. Take advantage of the natural
accumulation of
complacency in your captors. On day forty of your
captivity, they will not
be nearly as attentive as they were on day one.
Unlike the wardens of
organized, ultramodern prison facilities, captors
aren’t generally working
in airtight security contexts. There will be holes in
their routines and
structural vulnerabilities in their detainment
compounds, and the watchful
captive will observe, catalog, and exploit these
security gaps over time.
Staying focused on this constant state of information


--- Page 173 ---
collection will have
the beneficial side effect of keeping the captive
mentally alert.
Watch, wait, and plan. Collect tools and ideas. An
empty room is not as
empty as you think. Gather nails and splinters from
furniture, scrape paint
chips off the wall, break pieces of metal away from
air vents.
--- Page 169 ---
There’s no telling what a particular escape path may
look like, but any
routine that involves temporarily moving you out of
the containment space
is an opportunity to gather intel or make a run for
it. Use glimpses of
external facilities to catalog information that may
--- Page 169 ---
be useful for escape.
Where are the exits? Where are guards stationed? When
are guards’
mealtimes?
A locked door that is temporarily opened presents an
opportunity to
tamper with the strike plate, the part of a lock into
which the deadbolt
enters. Each time you pass through the doorway,
surreptitiously pack the
strike plate with a balled-up wad of paint stripped
from the wall.
Eventually, you will have created a situation in
which the deadbolt isn’t
fully seated and can easily be pushed back into the
door with a nail or
other piece of thin metal debris.
--- Page 250 ---
PART VIII
SIGNALING FOR HELP


--- Page 174 ---
--- Page 251 ---
088  Send a Distress Signal by Day
Carved in sand or etched in rock, old-school distress
signals carry a whiff
of the outdated desert island adventure tale. But
when technology fails and
options are limited, they may represent your only
possible means of
communicating with search and rescue teams or
passersby.
--- Page 170 ---
Whether you’re leaving signals in the aftermath of a
crisis in an urban
environment or you’re stranded in a desolate rural
setting, your strategies
will depend on how you are most likely to be found.
If you’ve been
--- Page 170 ---
separated from a group or know that an on-foot search
and rescue team
represents the most likely rescue scenario, use text
or symbols to leave a
physical trail marking your direction of travel.
Date-and time-stamp your
messages if you can. Every expedition pack should
include Sharpies and
duct tape in bright colors that contrast the natural
environment, but if
you’re traveling light or caught unaware, you can
make a trail out of found
natural objects or use your clothing and urine to
create a scent trail for
rescue dogs.
Distress signals meant to catch the attention of
aircraft or watercraft
must leave a much larger signature, whether by means
of smoke, glare, or
SOS messaging. A large fire lit during the day will


--- Page 175 ---
benefit from the
addition of pinecones, rubber, or petroleum-or
plastic-based products.
These will create plumes of black smoke, particularly
useful in a snowy
environment in which white or gray smoke may not be
visible. A laminated
ID card, the bottom of a can, or a shard of glass can
all be pointed toward
the sun and flashed toward passing aircraft to create
an attention-getting
--- Page 171 ---
reflective glare.
Oversize distress signals carved into sand and snow
must contrast with
the environment. Fill the carved-out lettering with
leaves and grass, rocks,
or other materials to create differentiation.
--- Page 252 ---
--- Page 171 ---
--- Page 253 ---
089  Send a Distress Signal at Night
A multitude of unpleasant scenarios may call for the
use of nighttime
distress signals. But while emergencies may feel more
harrowing in the
dark, the good news is that you have a great many
signaling options
available to you after sundown.
To signal person-to-person, a flashlight can be
pointed directly at
passing cars, through neighbors’ windows, or down to
emergency
responders. Set a flashlight to strobe or use your
hand to create an SOS
flicker.
The panic button on your vehicle will not only set
off the alarm but also


--- Page 176 ---
get hazards and headlights flashing. If you’re
trapped in a commercial
building during a power outage, the building’s
battery-operated emergency
lights can be unscrewed from the wall and used to
signal out a window.
Use your hand or a piece of paper to create an
emergency flicker.
When signaling from ground to air, you’ll need to
increase the signature
of your light source for it to be seen from a great
distance. A flashlight can
--- Page 172 ---
be turned into a buzz saw of light particles whirring
above your head or
used to lasso a passing aircraft. Point the beam of
light at the aircraft, then
illuminate your coordinates by sweeping the light
down toward the ground
(scattering the light particles so they create a
wider and more visible
--- Page 172 ---
footprint) and back up to the aircraft. Alternating
between these two
positions may catch the attention of aircraft even if
pilots aren’t looking
for you.
Both light and fire can be set up in the triangular
pattern that is the
universal symbol for rescue—whether you’re using
bundles of ChemLights,
upright flashlights, or a trio of campfires. The
latter can be particularly
useful in a jungle environment where a triple canopy
prevents visibility
from above. When waterways are the only pieces of
land that aren’t
covered in trees and brush, light fires aboard rafts


--- Page 177 ---
tied down with vine or
rope.
--- Page 254 ---
--- Page 255 ---
090  Send a Distress Signal on a Smartphone
The unparalleled convenience of our portable
communication systems
arms modern civilians with both an endless source of
entertainment and a
sophisticated personal safety device. With the touch
of a finger, you have
the power not only to occupy a small child for hours
but also to
--- Page 173 ---
immediately summon a team of first responders to your
exact location. If
the battery runs out before you get the call out,
however, the lifesaving
potential of your device will be significantly
diminished.
To preserve battery life during emergencies, place
--- Page 173 ---
your ringer on silent,
turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, lower illumination, and
shut down any
nonessential apps. Turn on location services in your
general settings to
enable law enforcement authorities to track your
phone.
Be clear, calm, and direct in your communications
with emergency
dispatchers. Though 911 operators will default to
keeping you on the
phone, once you’ve communicated the information and
answered their
questions, politely explain that you need to conserve
battery life and would
prefer to end the call. If you don’t know your cross


--- Page 178 ---
streets or coordinates,
use visible landmarks and businesses to give a
dispatcher the best possible
sense of where you might be.
If your signal is too low to place a call, send a
text. Text-to-911
capability is only supported in certain areas, so
follow up an attempted
text to 911 with a mass text to loved ones and anyone
you know in the
vicinity. Follow the general format outlined
opposite, being sure to add a
request for confirmation texts (not calls) in
response.
--- Page 174 ---
If the signal completely fails, use your phone to
send reflective distress
signals during the day (see page 224) or illuminated
signals at night (page
226). As an option of last resort, a dead phone can
be used to start a fire
(page 68).
--- Page 256 ---
--- Page 174 ---
--- Page 257 ---
091  Leave a DNA Trail
Plotting your escape (see page 220) and outlining
your memoirs aren’t the
only useful ways to spend your time while in
captivity. Through a series of
simple, undetectable measures, you can also endeavor
to leave a trail of
your own DNA behind—while simultaneously collecting
your adversary’s
blood, skin, and hair. Leaving behind a swath of your
genetic data creates
a bread-crumb trail for law enforcement officials to
follow if you’ve been


--- Page 179 ---
moved to a second location. And collecting your
adversary’s data has
obvious benefits for both investigators and
prosecutors.
In the worst-case scenario, if you do not survive the
ordeal, your trail of
evidence may at least lead to a future conviction. An
act of resistance, the
consequences of which could ultimately lead to
justice being served, your
actions will serve as an invisible but potent message
scrawled on the walls:
“I was here.”
Smear your skin, hair, sweat, urine, and blood in
spots that are difficult
--- Page 175 ---
to clean or that may be overlooked by a criminal
hastily covering his
tracks: corners of room, walls, air vents, and door
hinges. Law
enforcement officials will find these markers of your
forced detention.
Use violent or nonviolent contact with your adversary
to collect his
genetic material and store it on your body. Skin and
--- Page 175 ---
blood cells trapped
under your fingernails will generally stay there.
Wipe body fluids on the
underside of your hair or under your armpits to
ensure that they aren’t
rubbed off by repeated contact or washed away in the
event that your
captor forces you to shower. If he does, discreetly
attempt to wash around
collection areas.
Employ these measures even in the event that you find
yourself


--- Page 180 ---
temporarily restrained in the trunk of a car. There’s
no telling what the
future holds.
--- Page 258 ---
--- Page 259 ---
PART IX
EMERGENCY MEDICINE
--- Page 260 ---
092  Primary Assessment
Whether they are the result of urban or natural
disaster or mass violence,
catastrophic events with multiple victims strain the
limits of our
comprehension. Even civilians trained in basic first-
aid may be at a loss
when it comes to a response. But if you’re lucky
--- Page 176 ---
enough to survive a mass
casualty scenario unscathed, or to arrive late enough
to bypass the event,
following a triage protocol once you’ve called 911 is
the most effective way
for you to help.
--- Page 176 ---
Determine Level of Consciousness
Start by determining the victims’ levels of
consciousness. Announce your
name, then call out a simple series of commands: “I’m
here to help. Get up
and come toward me if you can. If you can’t, raise
your hand or shout.”
No rule of triage is ironclad, but generally, victims
who are ambulatory
should be treated after those who are conscious but
unable to move.
Unconscious or unresponsive victims are your last
priority. If one victim is
bleeding out and another is unconscious, staunching


--- Page 181 ---
the blood loss is the
most effective use of your time.
On the other hand, though your first instinct may be
to run to the
victim who’s audibly screaming for help and spend the
bulk of your time
attending to him or her, the ability to scream
demonstrates an ability to
breathe. There may be someone nearby with a chunk of
debris lodged in
his or her throat, minutes away from a herniation of
the brain.
Use the ABC Method
Check to see if a victim who is not alert can respond
to the sound of your
voice. If not, prod the victim to see whether he or
she can respond to
--- Page 177 ---
sensory stimuli. If there is no response, the victim
is unconscious.
Difficult decisions like these are the reason triage
protocol has
responders use the ABC (airways, breathing,
circulation) method. To
employ, 
check 
airways 
--- Page 177 ---
immediately 
after 
determining 
level 
of
consciousness (LOC), followed by breathing and
circulation.
--- Page 261 ---
Assess Airway: Assess the victim’s airway by
listening for breath. If you


--- Page 182 ---
don’t hear breath, use your hand to open the victim’s
mouth. Look for any
visible obstruction that could be preventing airflow;
if you spot something,
carefully attempt to remove the object; if not, use
your index finger to do a
shallow sweep (too deep and you’ll engage the gag
reflex).
Assess Breathing: Assess breathing by observing the
movement of the
lungs. Are both lungs moving? Does one move less than
the other? Put
your ear to the person’s chest and see if you can
hear the breath moving in
and out of the chest cavity. Simultaneously, you can
assess blood pressure
by placing your index and middle fingers just to the
left or right of the
--- Page 178 ---
person’s Adam’s apple. A pulse at the neck is good, a
pulse at the wrist is
very good, and a pulse behind the knee indicates
excellent circulation.
Assess Circulation and Control Bleeding: Once you’ve
assessed the
airways and lungs, move on to circulation. Identify
serious wounds and
apply pressure or a tourniquet (see page 238) to
stanch blood flow.
--- Page 178 ---
Mouth-to-mouth and CPR can be lifesaving methods of
resuscitation, but
in a mass casualty scenario, a generalized triage
must take precedence over
techniques that will tie first responders down to the
least responsive
victims for long periods of time. Following triage
best practices will enable


--- Page 183 ---
you to help more people, as well as provide valuable
information to the
first emergency workers to arrive on the scene.
--- Page 262 ---
--- Page 263 ---
--- Page 264 ---
--- Page 265 ---
093  Stop the Bleeding
Panic may be a natural response to the sight of major
blood loss, but swift
action can mean the difference between life and
death. Any civilian who is
witness to a catastrophic injury has the power to
halt blood loss and stave
off organ failure, using only his or her bare hands.
Direct pressure is the first line of action. Act
quickly, particularly if the
blood is bright red—arterial blood loss can quickly
lead to organ failure.
--- Page 179 ---
Immediately place the heel or palm of your hand
directly on the wound
and apply a significant amount of pressure. Use your
body weight. Your
goal is to choke off the artery by pressing it down
--- Page 179 ---
against the bone. If the
injured person isn’t yet on the ground, help him or
her down so that you
aren’t working against gravity.
If you can’t stop blood loss using direct pressure,
try applying equally
intense force to one of the vascular pressure points
illustrated opposite.
Choose the point just above the injury site. If you
don’t see an abrupt
slowdown in blood flow, try again in the general
vicinity. Use the heel or


--- Page 184 ---
blade of your palm on large muscle masses or if the
injured person is
overweight.
If none of these options successfully control the
bleeding, use a shirt, a
pair of pants, or a belt as a tourniquet. Tie off the
limb above the wound,
as close to the wound site as possible, and get the
injured person medical
attention ASAP. Left on too long, a tourniquet will
cause tissue death to
healthy parts of the limb and may lead to amputation.
Once blood loss has been controlled, bandage the
injury and elevate the
injured area above the heart if possible. In all
cases, get help immediately.
--- Page 266 ---
--- Page 267 ---
094  Treat Gunshot Wounds
More than seventy thousand people are treated for
--- Page 180 ---
gunshot wounds each
year in the United States alone, yet most civilians
know little to nothing
about how to help a shooting victim before emergency

workers have
arrived. In the event that the victim is hit in a
life-threatening location like
the brain, heart, or lungs, fatality may result
before medical intervention
can be undertaken. But blood loss from wounds in
other locations can
sometimes be managed through the use of direct
pressure, indirect
pressure, or a tourniquet. (See page 238 for more
detail on these
techniques.) In a pinch, combine direct pressure with


--- Page 185 ---
the use of a shirt, a
tampon, or a menstrual pad to slow the bleeding.
Feminine hygiene
products are designed to absorb large quantities of
blood, and if you
actually insert a tampon into the wound you may be
able to clot bleeding
at the source.
Internal trauma may be extensive, particularly if the
bullet has hit
organs or arteries. But again, there is little a
bystander can do about
internal injuries. What you can do is look for an
exit wound, so that you’re
controlling the bleeding on both ends. Be thorough,
as exit wounds may
not appear in logical places. Bullets can bounce
around inside body cavities
and travel along bone, so that a gunshot to the knee
results in an exit
wound at the pelvis.
--- Page 181 ---
Don’t be deceived by a small wound. Though a 9mm
bullet may cause
less cavitation (penetrating tissue trauma) than a
round of buckshot, the
latter has less velocity—and thus may be slightly
less likely to have lethal
consequences, depending on where it lands and the
--- Page 181 ---
distance of the shooter.
Attempt to keep the victim calm. Gunshot victims
frequently go into
shock, their blood pressure dipping as their bodies
enter a kind of
emergency conservation mode. Cover the victim with a
blanket to mitigate
against heat loss. Do not attempt to move the victim


--- Page 186 ---
if there is any chance
of a spinal injury.
For gunshot wounds to the chest, see page 242.
--- Page 268 ---
--- Page 269 ---
095  Occlude a Sucking Chest Wound
Whether it’s the result of unfortunate contact with a
sharp piece of
mechanical equipment or being at the wrong end of a
knife or bullet, a
puncture wound that lands anywhere near the chest
cavity poses a grave
risk not only to the heart, but also to the lungs.
There is little a bystander
can do about a wound to the heart other than perform
CPR and call for
help. While penetrating injuries to the heart don’t
necessarily result in
death, they certainly do require a surgical team.
But a chest wound that threatens the lungs can be
temporarily managed
by a bystander waiting for emergency services to
--- Page 182 ---
arrive, with a technique
based on the standard operating procedures used by
paramedics and
military medics.
Rather than use bandages to stop the bleeding, the
goal with any chest
--- Page 182 ---
wound is to occlude (seal) the wound to prevent air
from entering. Treat
any chest wound as if it may have caused a “sucking
chest wound,” also
known as a tension pneumothorax. The lungs are
surrounded by a pleural
sack, the thin membrane that protects organs from
surrounding tissues and


--- Page 187 ---
bones. If the pleural lining is punctured, air can
enter the pleural sack
through the wound site, putting pressure on the lung
and preventing it
from inflating. With every breath the victim takes,
more air enters through
the wound, and the lung is further compromised.
Use flat, impermeable materials such as credit cards
or plastic wrap to
create an occlusive seal over the wound, taping the
seal down on only three
sides so that you leave a flutter valve through which
air trapped inside the
pleural sack can escape. When the victim takes a
breath, the chest’s
expansion will put pressure against the occlusive
dressing, preventing air
from entering at the wound site.
--- Page 270 ---
--- Page 271 ---
096  Treat Foreign Object Impalements
Never, ever attempt to remove a sizable foreign
object that has penetrated
--- Page 183 ---
the skin to a significant depth or may have struck
near major arteries,
vessels, or organs. This misguided attempt to play
good samaritan could
result in severe tissue damage or worse. If the
--- Page 183 ---
foreign object has breached a
vessel or artery, its removal could cause sudden and
profuse bleeding. Even
in the case of an impalement to the foot, the very
common result of the
mishandling of kitchen knives or other sharp
implements, the foreign
object should never be removed on site. Removing the


--- Page 188 ---
object without
proper medical equipment and knowledge can cause
further tissue,
vascular, or arterial damage.
If the victim has impaled him-or herself on a large
or fixed object and
adequate tools are available, cut the victim free.
Fire trucks are stocked
with electric saws, so wait for emergency services to
arrive if you can’t free
the individual safely.
If the object is anywhere near the chest cavity, the
most useful thing a
bystander can do, after calling 911, is create a seal
around the impalement.
Chest impalements risk puncturing a lung—a “sucking
chest wound” or
tension pneumothorax being the life-threatening
result. Air that enters the
chest cavity through the wound depresses the lung,
preventing the victim
from taking a full breath. With every exhale, more
air enters through the
wound, further decreasing the victim’s lung capacity.
--- Page 184 ---
To prevent air from
entering the wound site, seal the area around the
object with a
combination of credit and ID cards and duct tape.
Once the impalement has been sealed, brace the object
to prevent it
from moving around or slipping further inside the
body. Surround the
--- Page 184 ---
protruding end of the object with a pyramid of rolled
up gauze or socks,
then tape down. For more detail on how to manage a
sucking chest


--- Page 189 ---
wound, see page 242.
--- Page 272 ---
--- Page 273 ---
097  Suture a Cut
If you’re within hours of a hospital, cleaning and
tightly bandaging a cut
should provide sufficient protection against
infection. But if the nearest
medical facility is more than twenty-four hours away
and adequate
materials are available, temporarily suturing a cut
that is over a quarter
inch in length may be advisable. Avoid attempting to
suture messy
nonlinear wounds, crater-like injuries, or extremely
deep lacerations. These
complex wounds are likely to require deep cleaning
and possibly skin
grafting. Avoid closing up a wound you can’t
adequately clean with boiled,
cooled water and/or alcohol—sealing contaminating
agents into a closed
environment is even more likely to breed infection
than leaving a wound
open to the external environment.
--- Page 185 ---
While the notion of piercing the epidermis or skin
with a needle and
thread will be off-putting to most civilians, the
skill is achievable by
anyone with even minimal sewing experience.
To determine what type of stitch to use, consider its
placement and
--- Page 185 ---
shape (see illustrations). Interrupted stitches are
time-consuming and may
be challenging to those with thicker or less
dexterous fingers, but they


--- Page 190 ---
provide a tight seal and can be adapted to jagged
lacerations. Continuous
stitches are the fastest and easiest option, but they
can leave gaps in a
wound or loosen up over time. Lock-stitch sutures, in
which the needle is
looped upward through the preceding stitch after each
horizontal loop, are
a step more secure than continuous stitches but tend
to scar.
Because the skin of the scalp is thin and stretched
very tight, stitching it
will prove difficult to impossible. Instead, a viable
improvised suture can
be made by knotting pieces of hair together over the
wound and super
gluing the knots.
Medical tape can be used to bypass the needle
altogether. Butterfly the
tape by pinching pieces at their center to protect
the oozing portion of the
wound. Secure tape on either side of the wound.
--- Page 274 ---
--- Page 275 ---
098  Treat Minor Burns
You may think you’re already familiar with the basics
--- Page 186 ---
of burn treatment
and fire safety. Stop-drop-and-roll if you catch on
fire, smother the
affected party in a blanket if you’re a bystander.
But if you’ve ever applied
an ice pack to a burn wound in search of relief, a
--- Page 186 ---
review of fundamentals is
in order—ice can cause frostbite to recently burned
skin and also prohibits
healing.


--- Page 191 ---
Most burn care follows the same initial protocol,
whether the burn is
thermal (caused by direct contact with heat or
flame), a scald (caused by
exposure to hot liquid or steam), chemical (caused by
contact with a
corrosive chemical substance or weapon), or
electrical (caused by exposure
to a live electrical current).
Second-or third-degree burns of any type must be
treated as emergencies
—second-degree burns reach down to the deeper layers
of the skin, and
third-degree burns may cause severe, irreparable
damage to ligaments,
tendons, bones, and internal organs. Both render
victims extremely
susceptible to serious infection. Internal burns,
whether to the lungs or the
digestive system, must be treated by medical
professionals; any time a
corrosive substance is ingested, get the victim to
the hospital or a poison
control center as soon as possible. Chemical burns to
the skin should also
be treated immediately, though they may not produce
symptoms or
--- Page 187 ---
sensations until hours after contact.
Only first-degree burns, which affect just the
epidermis, the most
superficial layer of skin, can safely be treated at
home. Run cold water
over the affected area (or dip in a cold river or
stream), then apply a pain-
relieving antibiotic ointment or the time-tested home
remedies of yellow
--- Page 187 ---


--- Page 192 ---
mustard or soy sauce. Their effectiveness has not
been proven by medical
studies, but the anecdotal and experiential evidence
is strong. Keep burns
clean and dry to avoid infection.
For information on smoke inhalation and escaping a
burning building,
see page 204.
--- Page 276 ---
--- Page 277 ---
099  Splint Fractured Bones
Painful and slow to heal but generally not life-
threatening, broken bones
are among the most common of childhood injuries. But
when they occur
far from civilization or medical facilities, they can
certainly become a
threat to survival.
If your location means you’ll be moving yourself or
the victim of a
broken bone to a medical facility on your own,
splinting the bone will help
reduce pain. More important, immobilizing the injured
limb may prevent
the jagged end of the bone from shredding tissue,
arteries, or veins inside
the body. The breaking of the bone itself can result
in significant blood
--- Page 188 ---
loss, as the blood marrow inside the bone is
dispersed throughout the
body, and in combination with broken vessels may be
responsible for
severe internal bleeding. For these reasons, any
broken bone must be
treated as soon as possible. Do not exert pressure on
the fracture site.
--- Page 188 ---


--- Page 193 ---
The goal in splinting is to temporarily immobilize
the broken bone by
taping the length of the limb to a rigid, stabilizing
object, the “splint.”
Splint the bone above and below joints on either side
of the injury site. For
a break at the shin, extend the splint from the ankle
past the knee.
When combined with duct tape, folded-up newspaper,
ski or hiking
poles, sticks, and even pillows can be called into
service as temporary
splints. Once you’ve splinted the limb straight,
further immobilize the
injury site by taping or wrapping the limb against
the body; arms should
be nestled against the torso, legs pinned together.
For hip fractures, tape the legs together at the
thighs.
For broken ribs, gently attach the arm on the injured
side to the body
and avoid movement, as a broken rib in motion can
puncture a lung.
--- Page 278 ---
--- Page 279 ---
100  Perform a Cricothyrotomy
Like many emergency medicine skills, a cricothyrotomy
is only to be
performed by an untrained bystander as a method of
--- Page 189 ---
last resort. Creating
an alternate airway by punching a hole through the
cricothyroid
membrane should be attempted only when a massive
trauma such as a
vehicular collision has mangled the victim’s upper
airway or a foreign
--- Page 189 ---


--- Page 194 ---
object has lodged in his or her airway and cannot be
removed—and after
an attempt to sweep the airway and a Heimlich
maneuver have both failed,
emergency services have been contacted, and the
victim has lost
consciousness due to lack of airflow. Continue to
attempt the Heimlich
maneuver as long as the victim is gasping, choking,
wheezing, or displaying
any other audible breathing attempts. Describe the
victim’s symptoms to
the 911 operator, and only proceed if the dispatcher
agrees that the
procedure is necessary.
In a test of the efficacy of bystander
cricothyrotomies, 57 percent of
junior doctors and second-year medical students with
no prior experience
operating on airways were able to successfully
perform simulated
interventions, using only a scalpel and a ballpoint
pen. This study,
supported by a small number of documented
interventions, suggests that
though the rate of success for civilian bystanders
would be much lower, the
use of these tools does offer some hope in situations
where the only other
alternatives are irreversible brain damage or death.
--- Page 190 ---
Severe brain damage
and/or complete brain death can occur after a mere
three to seven minutes
without oxygen, so time is of the essence when
dealing with airway
obstructions.
Begin by quickly preparing your tools. You’ll need a


--- Page 195 ---
sharp knife to
make the incision, and a durable straw-like tube or
pen barrel to create the
--- Page 190 ---
airway. The thicker the pen, the better the chance
that its barrel will create
a viable airway. Studies have identified the oversize
durable straws found
in sports bottles as a better choice. But most of us
are more likely to have a
pen in a purse or back pocket—and a situation in
which a victim may be
--- Page 280 ---
near death calls for the use of the best available
option. More extensive
first-aid kits may contain endotracheostomy or ET
tubes, and these are the
obvious first choice. If using a pen, remove and
discard the ink cartridge
and the top and bottom parts of the pen, so that all
you are left with is the
barrel.
--- Page 281 ---
--- Page 282 ---
Palpate the neck to locate the Adam’s apple, a lump
formed by the angle
of the thyroid cartilage as it surrounds the larynx.
If it isn’t visually
prominent, slide your fingers down the victim’s neck.
The first solid
protrusion is the Adam’s apple, and you want to aim
--- Page 191 ---
for the space just
below it—the cricothyroid membrane that connects the
thyroid cartilage to
the cricoid cartilage. After an initial cut through
the skin, you’ll be
punching through this membrane in order to clear a


--- Page 196 ---
new pathway to the
--- Page 191 ---
trachea.
The skin at the neck is very thin, which means that
you need to be
extremely careful in performing the initial cut.
Slice too deep and you
could be lacerating deeper layers of tissue and
cartilage. The jugular veins
and carotid arteries lie just to the side of the
cervical vertebrae, so your cut
must be centralized. Cut too low, and you’ll be
slicing into the thyroid
gland. To ensure that your first cut slices only
through the skin, pinch the
skin just below the Adam’s apple and pull it away
from the throat. Make a
perpendicular, quarter-inch horizontal cut in the
loose skin.
Now the underlying membrane will be exposed. Aiming
at the
indentation between the two rings of cartilage (the
thyroid and the
cricoid), use the tip of your knife to puncture the
membrane. A small,
shallow incision is all that is needed; the system
will work more efficiently
if there’s a tight seal around the breathing tube.
Though there will be some
blood, typically this maneuver should not result in
profuse blood flow.
Force the barrel of the pen or ET tube into the
--- Page 192 ---
incision. To quickly
check the airway, look for misting, feel for airflow,
or suck on the tube to
confirm airflow. Administer two to three breaths
through the tube. If the


--- Page 197 ---
intervention was successful, the victim should
thereafter begin to breathe
through the airway on his or her own.
If breathing does not resume and a pulse is not
discernible, begin to
--- Page 192 ---
perform CPR.
