Introduction
About this Book
The format of this book is based on the text of 150
Questions for a Guerrilla by General 


--- Page 16 ---
Alberto Bayo, first published in 1963 by Robert K.
Brown, Inc. Bayo was one of Castro’s 
generals during the Cuban revolution, and so his book
was popular for a few years. 
Bayo’s book did not address many survival-related
issues, and was mainly concerned with 
guerrilla tactics and communist strategies.
I have been inspired by Bayo’s work in using the
question-and-answer format and 
the combination of practical advice and philosophical
concepts as an effective method 
of conveying information and inspiration to the
reader. The questions here fall into two 
categories. There are the obvious “how to survive”
questions such as, “what survival 
items should a survivalist carry on his or her person
at all times?” I draw my answers for 
these types of questions from more than forty years
of studying disasters and human 
behavior while teaching over one hundred classes and
field operations. I also draw on 
my forty-year career in industrial safety management
and experiences as an EMT and 
in various emergency volunteer organizations. The
second category of questions relate 
to the survivalist psychology and philosophy,
containing questions such as “What is a 
survivalist?” As a high-profile survivalist since the
early 1980s, I have been frequently 
challenged by reporters and interviewers to explain
and justify survivalism and its practices. 
Here I will endeavor to clarify and establish the
meaning of the word “survivalist” from 
my own perspective. I hope this book can aid in
establishing the positive and responsible 
foundations of the true survivalist for the lay
reader. I have intentionally mixed practical 
questions and answers with those related to
psychological and philosophical subjects in 
order to establish their equal importance and


--- Page 17 ---
underline the relationships of these elements 
to survival thinking. Some amount of redundancy is
unavoidable, as the answers to the 
questions often overlap in some of the content. I
tried to add a bit of different information 
with each entry, but if a point comes up several
times, then it simply emphasizes its 
importance and demonstrates that it is worthy of
repetition.
This book provides me the opportunity to cover
numerous survival subjects and share 
survival information from my many articles that were
not included in my previous books. 
I felt obligated to provide complete instructional
answers to each question rather than 
simple, abbreviated tips. Answers range from a
paragraph to several pages, the latter 
instances demonstrating where I felt it was important
to leave the reader fully informed 
and prepared.
Where necessary, I have added illustrations and
photos to aid understanding. The 
challenge of 150 questions drew me to examine
survival topics and scenarios that 
went beyond any of my previous books and articles.
The complete mix of practical, 
psychological, and philosophical material covered in
this book makes it closer to a true 
--- Page 14 ---
xiv  James C. Jones
survivalist manifesto than any other survival book I
have encountered. As always, my 
objective is to aid responsible citizens in their
efforts to survive the increasing dangers 
and challenges of our times and attain greater levels
of personal and family self-reliance.
Self Introduction
Born shortly before the outbreak of World War II, I


--- Page 18 ---
was raised on the South Side of 
Chicago. My childhood was challenging, to say the
least, as it was neither sheltered nor 
normal. In those days the South Side was still on the
fringes of the city and there were 
still farms, woodlands and marshes to explore. I was
building shelters and campfires by 
the age of eight. I felt safer and more comfortable
in the woods than at home. There were 
months when food at home was scarce, or the water had
been turned off, or the electricity 
went off for a while. At that time, we had a coal-
burning furnace, and since we couldn’t 
afford coal, many times I would take my sled or wagon
and gather wood and coal along 
the railroad tracks to warm the house. The word
“survivalist” may not have existed yet, 
but I certainly became one at an early age.
We were evicted from our home a month after I
graduated from grammar school. My 
parents split up, and I began earning a few dollars
from my two paper routes. Soon after, 
I worked at odd jobs throughout high school. I had to
walk several miles to school, then 
walk home, and then walk several miles to my jobs.
Having lost all of my winter clothing 
to the eviction, I had to get through that first
winter walking in street shoes and a spring 
jacket in the snow and wind. I learned some true
winter survival lessons there.
Around that time, the South Side of Chicago was just
starting to go through the 
unrest and chaos that eventually boiled over into the
riots of the 1960s and the ongoing 
violence that pervades the region to this day. Yes,
urban survival tactics were a necessity.
 Profilers will tell you that people that grow up
under these conditions tend to be 
extremely self-reliant, cautious, and independent.
Guilty as charged. I had many jobs 


--- Page 19 ---
after high school, and it seemed like I always wound
up in charge of something. My final 
employer was a major chemical company. My tendency to
recognize and analyze risks was 
quickly recognized there, and I was given a
succession of safety-related responsibilities. As 
safety and health evolved into a recognized
profession, schools and organizations began 
to provide certification courses in related skills
including hazard recognition, hazard 
analysis, hazard control, incident investigation,
safety management, and emergency 
planning. I took all of these courses and more. They
proved crucial in that the skills 
taught there provided a scientific and organized
foundation for the survival subject that 
I was teaching and advocating.
I had been teaching and learning survival skills with
a group of friends for many years 
when the term “survivalist” attracted the attention
of the media in the early 1980s. The 
misinterpretation of the word and the people and
groups that the media were identifying 
as “survivalists” at that time was insulting and
misleading. The image the media 
portrayed was of a selfish, violent, dangerous, and
even hateful philosophy. In response 
to this unfair and distorted coverage, I did multiple
interviews for major newspapers, 
--- Page 15 ---
150 Survival Secrets  xv
magazines, and television stations. Live Free USA,
the organization that I had created in 
the late 1960s, hosted several television and press
visits to our survival training events, 
and the media even made some special programs about
us. At this time, I underwent my 
training in public relations, while developing some


--- Page 20 ---
writing and presentation skills. My 
article “We Are Survivalists” was a popular and often
reprinted tract back then, and can 
be found on page 282.
I retired from my job at the chemical company after
forty years as a safety and health 
manager. This has allowed me to focus on putting
together everything that I have to offer 
in multiple magazine articles, preparedness
exposition presentations, and a few books. 
As my earliest days as a survivalist were about
personal survival, I found myself able to 
help my fellow citizens deal with the threats of
nuclear war during the Cold War. My 
deepest concern now is for the welfare of existing
and future generations that seem to be 
unprepared for and oblivious to the fragile nature of
our civilization. I will devote my 
remaining resources to organizing, advocating, and
supporting those wise enough and 
responsible enough to care about the future of life
and freedom.

1  What is a survivalist?
The term “survivalist” originated in texts and films
related to nuclear survival in the late 
1960s and entered the common lexicon in the late
1970s. According to Merriam-Webster, 
the definition is “A person who advocates or
practices survivalism.” This subsequently 
led to Merriam-Webster’s definition of “survivalism”
as “An attitude, policy or practice 
based on the primacy of survival as a value.” So a
“survivalist” is essentially a person who 


--- Page 21 ---
practices “survivalism,” while “survivalism” is the
concept that espouses that “survival” 
is a high-value goal in life. From that it seems that
being a survivalist is a fairly positive, 
responsible, and universal principle.
The majority of the world’s population were
survivalists until the mid-nineteenth 
or early twentieth centuries. If your ancestors had
not been practicing survivalists, you 
would not exist. Only in the last few hundred years
has a large portion of the human 
population been able to depend on machines for their
survival. The non-survivalist 
lifestyle is a fairly recent, and perhaps temporary,
development in civilization. We now 
have large numbers of persons who lack the capability
to take care of themselves or help 
their neighbors without relying on the so-called grid
system. They depend on electricity, 
piped-in or power-supplied water, effective
sanitation systems, police protection, prompt 
and available medical care, plentiful and safe food
supplies, nearby fire-suppression 
services, and temperature-controlled homes. The fact
that all of these supporting 
systems are vulnerable, fragile, and in some cases,
dependent on unreliable resources is 
vigorously denied by the masses of non-survivalists.
While the media and the government can no longer
completely deny the need for 
limited preparedness, both tend to disparage
survivalism and survivalists. Both are quick 
to label antisocial and extreme behavior as
survivalist tendencies. Meanwhile it is the 
nature of bureaucrats and the mass-media to present
themselves as omnipotent. The 
whole concept of self-reliance and the possibility
that things may happen that are beyond 
their control is difficult for those in power to
accept. Personal preparedness, self-reliance, 


--- Page 22 ---
and independence may be given lip service, but are
nevertheless disturbing concepts for 
many.
While the dictionary definitions are technically
correct, they hardly reflect the 
true identities of survivalists or the foundations of
survivalism today. Below, I offer my 
definitions based on my forty years of involvement
with the movement.
A true survivalist is a responsible citizen who has
become aware of the fragility and 
vulnerability of our life-support systems and
civilization and is actively working to 
achieve greater capabilities to provide for him- or
herself, and others, in emergencies and 
general disasters.
True survivalism is a movement of citizens toward
greater individual emergency 
preparedness and expanded self-reliance independent
of outside support and supply 
systems for extended or indefinite periods of time.
--- Page 18 ---
2  James C. Jones
True survival for a true survivalist is the ability
to stay alive biologically while 
remaining free in body and spirit, while also
retaining one’s moral and spiritual values, 
regardless of external threats and hazards.

2  Is survivalism political?
The media often try to portray survivalists as
members of an extreme, right-wing political 
faction. In fact, survivalism is better described as
apolitical or antipolitical in nature. 
Politics and political conflict are rooted in


--- Page 23 ---
government policies and how they should be 
applied to people. Survivalism is rooted in
individual self-reliance and how people can 
help themselves and others without government
involvement.
The survivalism movement grew out of the chaos of the
1960s and was pioneered by 
both conservatives and liberals who had become
frustrated and disenchanted with the 
use of government as a solution to problems. These
back-to-the-land elements are evident 
today as what I call “soft survivalism” and “hard
survivalism.” Soft survivalism tends to 
focus on back-to-the-land and rural self-reliance
philosophies, while hard survivalism 
focuses on disaster preparedness and urban survival
necessities. These elements become 
political when government policies start to infringe
on individual self-reliance and basic 
freedoms. For example, when zoning has an effect on
water usage, livestock, gardening, 
and other self-reliance issues, it becomes political.
Laws that affect firearms ownership, 
self-protection, or stocking of survival supplies are
also survival political issues. Therefore, 
conservatives, liberals, libertarians, and
independents may all be survivalists, even if they 
do not recognize it in themselves. Anyone who rejects
governmental intervention, control 
of others, and the expectation of governmental
solutions to every issue, and is also inclined 
to take responsibility for their own security and
well-being, is a survivalist at some level.
While survivalism as a practice is not political, it
can have tremendous political effects. 
As our society marches headlong toward a totally
centralized and regulated future, those 
who value self-reliance, privacy, and personal
independence will unavoidably come into 
conflict with the state, and that may become a


--- Page 24 ---
serious political issue in the near future. 
For example, eighteenth-century persons living in
Great Britain’s American colonies were 
living well and taking care of themselves without the
need or desire for directions and 
support from the central British state well before
the American Revolution. This same 
dichotomy exists today between modern, centralized,
and regulated systems and human 
values of self-reliance and independence.

3  �What is the difference between a 
survivalist and a prepper?
The term “survivalist” was used for decades before
the term “prepper” became popular. 
A major reason behind this change is that the media
had so misrepresented the term 
“survivalist” that those who started practicing the
skills of survival preferred to call 
themselves by this new term. However, many media
outlets quickly started to disparage 
that term as well. Luckily, preppers did not get such
a bad rap, because the need for 
survival preparations is harder to ignore today than
it was when survivalists first emerged 
in the 1980s. As a result some survivalists now call
themselves preppers, but few recent 
preppers will admit to being survivalists.
Prepping is simply making preparations to survive a
perceived or expected event. In 
practice, prepping is limited in scope and at least
partially fear-driven, with the terms 
“collapse,” “Armageddon,” and “apocalypse” used as
motivations. Survivalists, on the 
other hand, are self-reliant and independent at their
core. They are prepared around-
the-clock and never accept the stability of “normal.”


--- Page 25 ---
Prepping is a practice of responsible 
citizenship, whereas survivalism is a life philosophy
of responsibility and independence.
--- Page 21 ---

4  �What items should a survivalist 
carry at all times to help survive 
unexpected emergencies?
There are several items that a prepared survivalist
should always carry in 
his or her pockets if possible. These items provide
significant advantages 
in many emergency situations.
A Knife:
Always carry a knife of some type when possible. A
good-quality pocketknife, Swiss-
Army–style knife, or multi-tool with a knife are all
preferable. When those are too bulky 
or visible, a smaller penknife or even a keychain
knife is better than nothing. A knife 
gives the possessor a tremendous advantage in many
survival emergencies. Of course 
knives are prohibited on airplanes today, in many
public buildings, and at events where 
metal detectors and wanding are commonplace.
A single-blade pocketknife, a multiblade Swiss Army
knife, or multi-tool that includes a knife are all
good 
options. Smaller knives may be carried when
concealability is necessary.
There are many other items that a prepared
survivalist should try to have in pockets 
and purses at all times. These include:
Medical Information Cards
A brightly colored card with family emergency contact
information, your primary doctor’s 
contact information, a list of your medications,
medical conditions, and any things 


--- Page 26 ---
--- Page 22 ---
6  James C. Jones
you are allergic to (e.g., penicillin, sulfa drugs),
should be kept visible in your wallet or 
purse. If you are unable to respond to questions from
emergency medical providers, this 
information could save your life.
Miniature Flashlights
These small LED lights are cheap enough to have one
in every coat pocket. They are also 
small enough to keep on your keychain. Pitch darkness
is often an element of a disaster, 
and having even a small light can be critical to your
survival and rescue.
Whistles
Small, loud whistles can go in every pocket and/or on
a keychain. They are far better at 
attracting attention than yelling.
Bandanas
Large cloth bandanas can be used as emergency dust
masks, bandages, tourniquets, CPR 
masks, help flags, containers, and other emergency
uses.
Fire-starting Devices
Small magnesium fire starter devices, waterproof
matches, or even butane lighters are a 
real survival advantage in some situations. Fire
leads to having light and heat. Having 
this capability means that you can survive cold
conditions. Having these in coat and 
jacket pockets puts you way ahead in an emergency.
N95 Dust/Mist Respirators
While you can use a bandana or even napkins as an
improvised respirator to reduce 
dust and soot exposure, they are temporary and
ineffective at best. N95 rated dust/mist 
respirators are effective against most airborne
biological contaminates and toxins, as well 


--- Page 27 ---
as particulates and mists. These masks fold flat and
fit easily into the pockets. They do 
not protect against carbon monoxide or most chemicals
and gases. Some models are 
charcoal impregnated to offer short-term protection
from chemical contaminants as well. 
In some kinds of disasters the ability to breathe
safe air immediately trumps all other 
survival needs. Inhaling a toxic dust, deadly virus,
or poisonous chemical can instantly 
end your hopes for survival.
Aspirin
Anyone over fifty years old should carry at least two
aspirin tablets in a waterproof 
container at all times, unless allergic to them.
Aspirin can be taken at the first signs 
of a heart attack and may make a lifesaving
difference. If aspirin is not an option, have 
--- Page 23 ---
150 Survival Secrets  7
an alternative pain reliever. Many emergencies 
involve pain, and pain relief can be helpful in 
dealing with other emergency needs.
Weapons
The choice of weapons and when to carry 
them must depend on the individual, the 
environment, and the situation. Being 
totally unarmed is contrary to basic “survival 
thinking,” but still necessary in some 
situations. Carrying a small “pepper spray” 
should be a minimal defense and is legal in 
most situations. If concealed or open carry 
for a handgun is practical and safe for you, 
then purchase a good-quality compact or 
subcompact semiautomatic and the necessary holsters
or carrying devices to safely carry 
it and quickly deploy it if needed. Pocket carrying
or under-the-belt carrying is unsafe 


--- Page 28 ---
and may be slow to access in an emergency. Open
carry, even if legal, makes you the first 
target for a shooter and is not recommended.
Concealed carry provides you with the 
element of surprise and the choice of if and when to
act.
Assorted pocket survival items including 
bandana, aspirin, emergency information card, 
whistle, fire striker, knife, respirator, flashlight,
and pepper spray.
Concealable handguns such as the 9mm compact and the
357-caliber subcompact are ideal for street 
protection. The three-inch blade folding blade can be
used in defense and has other survival applications. 
The small (orange) pepper spray provides some
defense. The heavy, metal tactical pen is a last-
ditch option, 
but still better than nothing.

5  �How can a survivalist evaluate his/
her level of personal preparedness?
There is no such thing as being totally prepared. The
threat matrix is constantly 
changing, and the possible combinations of survival
challenges (big and small) are 
endless. Preparedness is not a goal or destination;
it is a lifelong way of thinking. There 
is no truly accurate way of measuring preparedness. A
wilderness survival “expert” will 
not last long in the inner city. Someone who is
prepared for Armageddon may be caught 
off guard by a local tornado or home fire. The score

6  �Is learning to start a fire with flint 
and steel or a fire-bow a must-have 
survival skill?


--- Page 33 ---
While visions of survivalists starting fires in the
wilderness with flint and steel or using a 
bow and fire board are familiar, it is highly
unlikely that you will have access to flint and 
steel or have the time and energy needed to start a
fire with various primitive methods. 
Learning these methods can be fun and gratifying, but
carrying magnesium fire starters, 
waterproof matches, or lighters at all time is far
more valuable and effective. What you 
should practice is starting a fire from a spark from
any source and building that into a 
sustainable fire.
A survivalist should be able to start and maintain a
fire with just a few sparks, one 
match, or one small flame starting with a nest of
fine dry grass, shredded paper, or other 
combustible materials. This you must practice and
eventually master. You must blow the 
spark or first small flame into a small fire and then
use that fire to ignite twigs. The 
twig fire consists of the slowly fed larger twigs,
small branches, and eventually sustainable 
branches and logs. Piling on too much fuel too fast
will smother the fire. Wet or damp fuel 
must be kept close so it can dry from the heat, but
not used as fuel until it is thoroughly 
dry. The proper balance of fuel and airspace must be
maintained to sustain combustion.
The fire train: Start by burning very fine dry tinder
such as dry grass or pine needles; use their heat to
ignite 
small twigs, then small branches, and eventually
larger logs. 
--- Page 28 ---
12  James C. Jones
Sticking sparks from a magnesium fire starter into a 
next of dry grass.


--- Page 34 ---
This teepee formation will provide a good fuel/air 
mix. The initiating fire of smaller branches would go
underneath.
Once you have sparks burning in the nest, you pick it
up and blow into it until a flame develops. 
An initiating fire under this spaced cabin will
quickly 
start the logs burning. Never just dump logs onto a 
beginning fire. 
A small fire here is drying the logs that are used as
a windshield 
and reflector. As they dry and are used, new logs are
placed there 
to dry. Credit: Bing

7  �Where should a survivalist keep 
survival packs and equipment?
Traditional thinking is to have the pack handy, in
the closet, or another nearby location, 
but if your home is damaged, on fire, or
inaccessible, having the pack in a shed, detached 
garage, or other close-by location may be better. You
may want to consider having a 
backup pack in such a secondary location just in
case. Your survival pack and other 
survival gear should be kept together. Boots,
weapons, canteens, knives, and clothing 
that will be needed during survival and evacuation
situations should be kept side by side. 
A heavy-duty tote bin is an ideal place to keep all
of this together. The bin protects the 
items and can easily be moved to safety or into your
vehicle, as needed.
This survival pack is inside of a large tote bin
along with 


--- Page 35 ---
boots, weapons, and other survival items. It is safe
and can 
be moved quickly.
--- Page 30 ---

8  �What is the difference between an 
evacuation pack, as described by 
FEMA, and a true survival pack?
The FEMA evacuation pack is a comparatively recent
innovation. This pack is intended 
to provide the necessities a person might need to
evacuate from an urban or suburban 
area to an outlying government shelter or camp. The
assumption is that the disaster 
will be of a limited area and duration so that the
refugee can walk to help in a few 
days and the help will be available. These packs are
light enough for most people 
to carry and are an excellent resource for every
responsible family. Since the federal 
government’s priorities are maintaining order and
compliance, FEMA’s lists never 
include self-protection devices. Considering the
chaotic conditions under which such 
packs would be necessary a wise world-be survivor
should consider the addition of a 
firearm.
The so-called survival pack, or bugout bag, was a
creation of true survivalists in the 
1960s. These packs incorporate backpacking concepts
with survival needs to create a 
long-term system based on the assumption that there
will be no outside support for 
an extended period. These packs usually include
cooking kits, water-filtration devices, 
shelters or small tents, sleeping bags, and food.
Additional weapons, knives, and tools are 
added to provide for hunting, foraging, and self-


--- Page 36 ---
defense purposes. These packs weigh 
more than the evacuation packs. The size and weight
of such packs depends greatly on 
the capacity of the survivor to carry them for some
distance. The would-be survivor is 
well advised to try carrying the pack for a least for
at least two hours at a time. If you can’t 
carry it that long, then it’s too heavy and must be
culled until you reach a sustainable 
carrying weight. If you have a group or family
involved, you can distribute some of the 
shelters, stoves, shovels, tools, and the like, that
you only need one of, to lighten the 
weight of each pack. If you anticipate a long-term or
long-distance survival situation 
without rescue or aid, this is the pack you need to
create.

9  �What items should go into a basic 
evacuation pack?
The following list is a survivalist modified FEMA
pack. It provides the minimum supplies 
to get through most short-term emergencies only.
  1.     (4) Sixteen-ounce water bottles
  2.     (1) Collapsible stove with heat tablets *
  3.     (1) Metal canteen cup or Sierra cup
  4.     (1) Fifty-hour candle (optional ten tea
candles)
  5.     (1) 5-plus LED flashlight
  6.     (1) Multi-band radio (AM/FM/weather, crank,
solar-, or battery-powered)
  7.     (1) Food bars (3,000 to 4,000 calories)
  8.     (1) Large rain poncho
  9.     (2) N95 dust/mist respirators
10.      (1) Space Emergency Blanket, tactical
blanket, or tube tent
11.      (1) Multifunction knife or multi-tool device


--- Page 37 ---
12.      (1) Box waterproof matches
13.      (1) Bottle water-purification tablets (or
filter device)
14.      (1) Bottle hand sanitizer
15.      (1) First aid kit
16.      (1) Pair extra glasses
17.      Spare pair of heavy socks
18.      Extra prescription medications
19.      (6) Chemical light sticks
20.      Document package with copies of birth
certificates, insurance papers, property 
titles, wills, medical information, critical phone
numbers, etc.
Note: Keep good hiking shoes with your pack. You do
not want to flee into the street or 
woods in flip-flops or slippers.
* Can be used to warm a vehicle or shelter, boil
water, or heat optional packets of coffee, tea, or 
hot chocolate in cold weather.
--- Page 32 ---

10  �What items should go into a full 
survival pack?
The contents of a true survival pack depend on the
individual’s needs, the climate 
and weather conditions anticipated, the kinds of
hazards and challenges that may be 
encountered, and of course, the physical capacity to
carry its weight. In cold conditions, 
one would need more adequate sleeping and shelter
items. If one is evacuating through or 
into hostile urban areas, then more attention must be
given to weapons. The list below 
provides a guide to building a true survival pack
suited toward your situation.
Items to be kept with pack that attaches  
to a belt or into the pockets:
  1.     Document package with copies of birth


--- Page 38 ---
certificates, insurance papers, property 
titles, wills, medical information, critical phone
numbers, etc.
  2.     Emergency plans and maps of routes and safe
areas.
  3.     Field boots for hiking. If you need your
pack, chances are you are not going to 
be wearing street shoes or flip-flops where you are
going
  4.     Some energy bars, trail mix, or jerky for the
pockets
  5.     A full, one-quart canteen and pouch to carry.
  6.     A high quality field knife such as the USMC
KA-BAR, USAF Survival Knife, 
or equivalent.
  7.     Small binoculars or monocular to view your
route.
  8.     Multi-tool (e.g., Swiss Army knife).
  9.     Sunglasses.
10.      A weapon. Pepper spray if all other options
are unavailable. A good handgun 
(Ruger .22 long rifle, Glock 9mm or .45 caliber,
etc.) with holster and extra 
magazines is recommended where legal. A Henry 22 LR,
US Survival Rifle, 
with its compact size and ability to float, could be
worth carrying. You can carry 
several hundred rounds of .22 LR ammunition in your
pockets.

11  �Is breaking into homes or 
looting justifiable under survival 
conditions?
Breaking into homes, looting, or committing robbery
and other criminal acts is not 
justified unless it is a true life-or-death
situation. True survivalists never use survival 
needs as an excuse to commit any kind of crime. We
are not looters! However, freezing 
when an empty home or building is available or
starving when food is accessible is also 
not acceptable. Do these things only if they are


--- Page 42 ---
fully justified. Limit damages. Take 
only what you need. Leave IOUs or cash. Survivalists
are the least likely to need to be 
desperate and dangerous in extreme emergencies since
they have already stocked up on 
food and have shelter items with them.
--- Page 37 ---
21
12  �Should a survivalist keep his/
her survival and preparedness 
interests a secret?
How confidential you keep your activities is strictly
up to you. Most survivalists neither 
hide nor flaunt their preparations. Certainly,
responsible citizenship and emergency 
preparedness are nothing to be ashamed of. The
details of your personal and family 
preparedness levels and plans should always be
confidential, but sharing knowledge and 
helping others toward greater preparedness may be
viewed as a moral imperative. The 
better prepared your family, neighbors, and community
are, the safer you are. Ignore 
those who denigrate your efforts, are in denial, or
are irresponsible. You have no obligation 
to help them before or during a disaster.
--- Page 38 ---
22
13  �What are the most probable 
emergencies that a survivalist 
may expect to face?
There are two classes of emergencies for which a
survivalist must be equally prepared. 
The first class consists of the evident local,
regional, and global disasters that attract the 
most attention and drive most preparedness efforts.


--- Page 43 ---
Tornadoes, cyberattacks, epidemics, 
economic collapse, and general apocalypse are usually
associated with survivalists 
and disaster preparedness, but small personal and
family disasters, the second class of 
emergencies, can be equally devastating. A true
survivalist is prepared for both kinds of 
events. You must ignore panic-peddling and media-
generated fright, while evaluating 
your own challenges. Here is a step-by-step guide to
your personal or family hazard 
analysis.
Step one:
Make a list of disasters that could realistically
happen to you. These could include tornadoes, 
floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes depending on your
location. Include those massive 
events that would impact you such as nuclear war,
epidemics, economic collapse, civil 
disorder, or the results of a massive cyberattack or
electromagnetic pulse on the grid. Don’t 
leave out personal disasters such as a home fire,
serious illness, being a victim of assault, or 
a toxic chemical leak at a nearby factory.
Step two:
Rate the probability of each actually happening to
you. For example:
•       
A score of zero would indicate that those items that
have virtually no 
possibility of happening to you and/or would have
little effect on you. These 
should not be on your list.
•       
A score of one would be for events that are slightly
possible, but would only 
constitute a nuisance or temporary problem.
•       
A score of two would be for events that realistically
could happen now or in 


--- Page 44 ---
the foreseeable future, and would significantly
impact your safety, health, and 
security.
•       
A score of three would include disasters, events, or
trends that appear probable 
or seem to be in progress that could lead to major
damages, catastrophic 
changes, and fatality for you or your loved ones.
--- Page 39 ---
150 Survival Secrets  23
•       
A score of four is reserved for imminent and truly
catastrophic events that are 
almost certain to happen with destructive and
injurious impacts to you and 
your loved ones.
•       
A score of five must be reserved for nationwide or
global apocalyptic disasters 
such as massive pandemics, nuclear war, or a complete
breakdown in the 
socioeconomic structure. These are events that cannot
be overcome and will 
require permanent adaptation for survival.
Step three:
You can now create a prioritized list of hazards that
you need to prevent, avoid, or survive. 
You may be able to avoid a tornado or a flood by
moving out of zones prone to those 
occurences. You may be able a avoid cancer and heart
disease by stopping smoking and 
getting more exercise. In addition to your general
survival preparedness (e.g., stored water 
and food, survival packs, etc.), you can make
specific preparations for the most probable 
and impactful events based on your personal risk
factors.


--- Page 45 ---
--- Page 40 ---
24
14  �What are the major catastrophic 
events and trends that survivalists 
may face in the coming decades?
In addition to the increasing number of localized and
passing emergencies that a survivalist 
must be prepared to face, there are a number of
developing threats and potentially 
devastating events that may well become apocalyptic.
Some of these would be evidenced 
by violence and chaos, while others would be more
subtle, but no less destructive.
Cyberattacks and Electromagnetic Pulses
The dangers of cyberattacks and electromagnetic
pulses are the result of a civilization 
that has become totally dependent on electronically
controlled systems for virtually 
every life-critical need. Our water supply, food
delivery, medical care, fuel supplies, 
police protection, banking systems, fire response
methods, and all other modes of 
communication are wired into computers and networks
that can be seriously damaged, 
or even destroyed, by a deliberate cyberattack, or a
human-caused or naturally occurring 
electromagnetic pulse. Most security experts rate
this as having a high probability of 
happening within the next decade.
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial intelligence is no longer a science-
fiction nightmare. Notable intellects, such 
as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have expressed
concerns that AI will seriously 
degrade humanity’s control of our own destiny and may
even conspire to implement 
“solutions” without concerns for traditional human
values and morals. AI has the 


--- Page 46 ---
potential to outthink humanity or even adjust human
thinking. This may already be 
in progress.
Worldwide Pandemics
Massive epidemics are considered one of the greatest
threats to human survival in the 
twenty-first century. The ever-growing world
population and the rise in world travel 
can facilitate the rapid spread of a devastating
pathogen before it could be recognized 
and isolated. Medical experimentation, mutation of
existing pathogens, and even 
deliberate distribution of a new biological weapon
could initiate a worldwide epidemic 
that could kill and debilitate a significant portion
of the population. This possibility is 
made more likely by the reduction in human immune
systems by overuse of antibiotics 
and disinfectants, and the emergence of more and more
drug-resistant bacteria. The 
--- Page 41 ---
150 Survival Secrets  25
secondary effects would be the collapse of the world
economy, massive civil disorder, 
famine, and war. Most experts predict that it is not
a matter of if, but when, such an 
outbreak develops.
Economic Decline
Economic decline or collapse seems unavoidable within
a few decades or even a few 
Years. The world’s population has already outgrown
the ability of the planet to support 
it at an acceptable level of comfort and security.
The multiplying financial crises of 
various nations and the massive flow of desperate
refugees is evidence of this unavoidable 
reality. Wealthier first-world nations remain stable,
but they cannot resist the pressures 


--- Page 47 ---
indefinitely. Whether there will be a catastrophic
and violent collapse or a series of 
downward bumps and adjustments is difficult to
predict, but hard times and deprivations 
are inevitable.
Climate Shift and Severe Weather
While “experts” argue about the causes, climate
change is a reality. The number of 
weather-related natural disasters has more than
doubled in the past ten years and continues 
to accelerate. Severe weather is now the norm. Every
year, heat waves, snowstorms, 
hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and droughts destroy
whole communities, devastate crops, 
kill thousands, and thus seriously damage an already
weakening economy. Most experts 
believe that we have already passed a “tipping point”
and can only expect a worsening 
environment in the decades to come.
Loss of Privacy and Self-Direction
While loss of privacy may not seem like a serious
“survival” hazard, it can defeat one’s 
efforts to prepare for or deal with threats as an
individual. To a true survivalist, survival 
is more than a biological imperative. If a human is
completely observed, monitored, 
and directed by a system or network, no matter how
benign, then he or she is no 
longer free and therefore has not survived.
Technology has evolved to the point where 
it is using people, rather than being used by people.
Those who frequent the internet, 
carry smartphones, and respond to various online
programs are profiled by massive 
computers to analyze how they think and therefore how
they react to various ideas. 
Human engineering and logarithms can manipulate
buying habits, political preferences, 
social associations, and even emotions. Think about
the implications of being wired to 


--- Page 48 ---
systems that have their own agendas. If you dismiss
this as simply paranoia, then you 
are exhibiting typical addictive behavior. This is
one of the most insidious and stealthy 
hazards to humanity.
--- Page 42 ---
26  James C. Jones
General Civil Disorder
Certainly, we can all recognize that violent
demonstrations, riots, and looting often 
follow natural and man-made disasters. These are
temporary, localized products of 
specific events. We can expect more frequent and
violent so-called demonstrations as 
both society and the economy weaken. What may be less
apparent is the slow breakdown 
of respect and lawfulness throughout society.
Shoplifting, street robberies, burglaries, 
car thefts, and other lesser crimes have become an
epidemic. Overworked urban police 
departments are increasingly unable to even try to
catch offenders, and the overloaded 
courts issue only “slap on the wrist” sentences. Both
the internet and social media have 
generated a society of division, hostility, and
conflicting information that has generated 
a culture of chaos, crime, and conflict where there
once was unity and mutual respect. 
As this trend continues, civil disorders will become
normalized, and property crimes will 
just be the norm. Civility is already gone, and
disorder is prevalent in every aspect of 
society already. Creeping anarchy is a prelude to
even worse conditions as time goes on.
Resource Depletion and Exhaustion
It is a simple reality that you cannot continue to
use a finite amount of any resource 
at an accelerating rate for an indefinite period of


--- Page 49 ---
time without that resource becoming 
exhausted. We are well past the tipping point in
using up our remaining petroleum 
and natural gas supplies. As the cost of draining
these last reserves increases, solar 
and wind energy are buying humanity some time but are
not permanent solutions, as 
they come with their own environmental issues. Since
petroleum is used for fertilizer, 
plastics, food preservation, and agriculture, its
decline will result in food supply issues. 
The expanded population concentrated in cities that
require massive amounts of energy 
for air-conditioning and heating may become
untenable. Even water supplies and arable 
land are becoming scarcer and will generate conflicts
in the near future. How long we 
have until resource depletion begins to generate
serious economic and social disaster is 
difficult to predict. Some of the effects are already
developing while other (out of gas) 
may take decades to come to fruition, but they are no
less inevitable.
While there are many more potential threats and
causations that can result in the end 
of life or freedom, these above are the most likely
to impact everyone now or in the near 
future. Several are difficult to recognize today
unless you look with open eyes.
--- Page 43 ---
27
15  Are major disasters and 
catastrophic events predictable?
The majority of the major disastrous events of the
past decades were not ones that had 
been predicted by experts in various fields and most
of the ones that did occur were not 
predicted. After a disaster, officials and experts


--- Page 50 ---
often construct narratives to explain how 
the event was predicted or predictable, although
those narratives seldom do so adequately. 
The scenarios for disasters and the complexity of the
elements involved make accurate 
predictions of what will happen, where, when, and
with what effects virtually impossible. 
There are just too many moving and interrelated parts
and too many unseen dots to 
connect. While there are many possible disaster
scenarios in everyone’s future, the most 
predictable scenario is an event or combination of
events that is not predicted or expected 
or that has effects outside of our expectations. In
other words, expect the unexpected.
--- Page 44 ---
28
16  �How likely is it that a survival-
level emergency will happen to me 
or my family?
You may want to consider assigning a percentage of
probability to various possible 
threats. How probable is it that a worldwide pandemic
will occur in the next ten years? 
How about the next twenty years? Will the economy
hold together for another five years? 
Will the supplies of petroleum, water, food, and
other essential needs manage to sustain 
the population as it expands indefinitely? The
probability of any particular scenario may 
be only 10 percent or less, but if there are ten or
more possibilities for a catastrophe, the 
probability that one or more will happen gets closer
to 100 percent. The potential of a 
given event such as total depletion of food, water,
fuel, and other items, may be low for 
the next ten years, but inevitable at some point in
the future. Things like pandemics and 


--- Page 51 ---
wars increase in probability with time. The
individual probability of needing to survive 
a particular disaster may be low, but the sum total
of probabilities and time virtually 
assures that one or more catastrophic events will
occur and will dramatically affect you 
and your family within the next decades.
--- Page 45 ---
29
17  �What is the domino effect  
of a disaster?
It is too easy to focus on preparedness for one kind
of disaster and assume that if we 
survive that event, then we can resume normalcy. A
cyberattack could shut down water 
supplies, food deliveries, sanitation systems,
petroleum and natural gas systems, and more 
for days or even months. This would lead to financial
collapse, civil disorder, and possible 
epidemics. A large-scale epidemic would cause workers
to abandon jobs at water-pumping 
stations, sanitation facilities, garbage collection
sites, and food-delivery locations. Even 
police, fire, and medical personnel would be stricken
or chose to stay home. The result, 
again is partial or total collapse of civilization as
we know it. A stealthier domino effect 
is already in progress. The growing frequency and
scope of natural disasters and the 
massive costs of counterterrorist security are
draining an already overtaxed economy. The 
result is dwindling budgets for fire, police, and
medical services. The more emergencies 
we have, the fewer resources we have to prevent or
cope with the next ones. In a world 
where everything is connected to everything else, the
potential for multiplying disasters 
is enormous.

18  �How can I survive a home fire that 
starts while I am asleep in bed?
A fire that starts while you are asleep is especially
dangerous because it takes you by 
surprise. You must have at least two smoke and carbon
monoxide detectors with fresh 
batteries in your home to give you a chance to
survive, but you must also act quickly and 
correctly. If you awaken to a smoke-filled room, do
not sit up! The air just above you may 
be heated to several hundred degrees, and filled with
toxic gases. Roll out of bed and 
crawl to the nearest exit. If the bedroom door is
closed, feel it for heat before opening it. If 
it’s too hot, you may need to open or break a window
to escape. If you are trapped or you 
have time, call 911. You have only seconds to get
out! A dust mask and a flashlight kept 
in the bedside drawer may save your life in the dark,
smoke-filled house. Once outside, 
never return to a burning building. You will probably
not come out again! You should 
have trained every member of your family in escaping
fire and have a meeting place 
outside. Fire doubles in size every one to two
minutes. You must move quickly.
--- Page 47 ---
31
19  �How can I survive a home fire that 
starts while I am awake?
If you are alerted to a fire starting in your home,
you first priority is to call the fire 
department and get everyone out of the house. The
best response time for their arrival is 


--- Page 53 ---
three to five minutes. This will be much longer
during a general emergency. Fire doubles 
every few minutes, so having fire extinguishers and
using them effectively can mean the 
difference between survivable damages and total
devastation for your possessions. If the 
fire has already filled a room with heavy smoke, or
it involves quantities of flammable 
liquids, or you are in any doubt that you can
extinguish it safely, just get out; no property 
is worth your life. The following sequence of photos
demonstrates how a small fire 
enlarges over just four minutes to engulf a room.
Survivability to escape would be less 
than three minutes.
--- Page 48 ---
32
20  �How do I fight a home fire with a 
fire extinguisher?
Good dry chemical extinguishers rated for “ABC” class
fires are available in many sizes. 
Class “A” fires are paper, wood, and cardboards, etc.
Class “B” fires are burning liquids 
such as gasoline, grease, or kerosene. Class “C” fire
is electrical. Your “ABC” extinguishers 
are good for all three, but any kind of water spray
can be used to extinguish a class “A” 
fire.
The most important thing about a fire extinguisher is
its location. They must be on 
hand when the fire starts. A few seconds spent
getting the extinguisher can mean that 
the fire is beyond control by the time you get back.
So you must have one in the kitchen, 
garage, furnace room, shop, and anywhere else that
you have an open flame or flammable 
fuels. They should be located near the doorway so you
can start fighting the fire with the 


--- Page 54 ---
door/escape route behind you.
How to Use a Fire Extinguisher
When using a pressurized powder extinguisher, one
should stand well back from the fire 
and aim just short of the front edge of the fire, in
order to let the powder roll over the 
flames. Then sweep back and forth, going just past
each side and farther in with each 
sweep until past the back of the fire. Don’t squirt;
keep sweeping. Be sure all flames are 
out before stopping. Then hold, ready to prevent
reigniting. Don’t blast the fire at close 
Typical fire extinguishers, like those above, are
available at most home supply stores. In terms of
fire 
extinguishers, bigger is better. Inspect your
extinguishers regularly. The larger ones on the right
can be 
refilled and repressurized. 
--- Page 49 ---
150 Survival Secrets  33
range! This will only blow burning fuel around. Be
careful not to walk into the fuel 
as you advance on the fire. It is always best to have
a second person at your back with 
another extinguisher ready. Never, ever let the fire
get between you and your escape 
route. Never try to fight a fire once the room is
filled with smoke.
When fighting a class “A” (wood, paper) fire, soak
the fire thoroughly and then use a 
shovel or other device to turn over the fuel and soak
hot spots. Consider that a fire goes 
up and out and looks for fuel and air. It may follow
vents, electrical openings, and other 
routes to ignite in between walls or in other rooms.
Search and destroy it and stay alert 
for rekindling for up to twenty-four hours.

21  �Is camouflage an important 
survival skill?
Camouflage is often associated with survivalists in
general, but its survival application 
depends on the situation. The wearing of various
camouflage garments has become so 
ubiquitous that it seldom attracts attention today.
We think of camouflage as patterns of 
various subdued colors such as “woodland,” “tree
bark,” or urban grays and blacks, but 
the true essence of camouflage is anything that
allows you to blend into the surrounding 
environment and so attract less attention. A suit and
tie, workman’s orange jumpsuits, 
or casual blue jeans would be good camouflage in some
situations. Wearing military-
looking camouflage shirts, pants, and coats is just
the opposite of camouflage in many 
other situations.
Active camouflage is an important part of military
survival training and is also 
practiced by hunters and to some extent by law
enforcement. In survival situations, 
camouflage can be used to evade detection by
criminals and looters. It can aid in hunting 
game for food, and it gives the survivor the choice
of when and if he or she becomes 
visible to others. While modern infrared and night-
vision technology can limit the 
effectiveness of camouflage, those devices have
limitations and may not be in use by 
those you are trying to evade. Therefore, knowing the
principles of camouflage is an 
important survival skill.
There are five key elements to good camouflage. They
are:


--- Page 56 ---
1.       Shape: The human form is distinct from most
surroundings. A round head 
peering over a rock will be noticed. A straight rifle
barrel stands out from bent 
and forked branches. Use branches, camouflage, or
netting to break up your 
shape and that of your equipment.
2.       Shining: Cover, enclose, or wrap up anything
you have that will reflect light. 
This includes jewelry, watches, glasses, buttons,
belt buckles, and binoculars. 
One glint of light off these day or night can undo
all your camouflage work.
3.       Silhouette: This is your shape against the
background. Is the sun or moon or 
town lights silhouetting you? A white gravel road, or
a snowy field, or white 
smoke behind you smoke can make you stand out as a
target.
4.       Shadow: You may be well hidden from direct
view, but your shadow may give 
you away. If you have successfully broken up your
shape it will help. Keeping 
low will also reduce your shadow.
5.       Shading: The colors and the shade (dark or
light) of the camouflage are the 
most important elements. They must match the
environment as closely as 
--- Page 51 ---
150 Survival Secrets  35
possible in pattern and color. As you move 
from one location (e.g., dry grass) to another 
(e.g., green forest) the effectiveness of your 
camouflage may be lost and require changing. 
Gilly suits and netting are good for staying in 
one location, but tend to snag, pull, and tear in 
movement. Fortunately, there is a big selection 
of camouflage clothing for just about every 


--- Page 57 ---
location and season. If you will be moving 
from civilization to escape and evasion, you 
may have to use basic dark and earth-tone 
clothing enhanced by foliage and paint when 
needed. Apply camouflage paint in patches or 
stripes across the face based on the patterns of 
light and shadow in the environment. The eye 
sockets, cheeks, and below the chin are generally
shaded and therefore should 
get most of the lighter green and tan colors, while
the more exposed nose, ears, 
and forehead get the darker green and black tones.
Don’t forget your neck and 
the back of your hands. If you don’t have camouflage
paint, dirt and charcoal 
can be used. Carrying camouflage gloves and a face
net or mask is handy if you 
don’t have time for paint.

36  James C. Jones
Other Important Considerations in Maintaining Stealth
Movement: Movement attracts the eye. Slow movement is
often missed, even if 
camouflage is poor. When you must move through a
location where observation is likely, 
move slowly and stay low.
Secondary motion: As you move, you may move branches


--- Page 58 ---
and tall grass or stir up dust. 
This may give away your presence and location.
Sight level: Whenever you stop moving or are
observing, do it while crouching or lying 
down. People naturally look at eye level. The lower
you are, the more you blend in to the 
ground and are literally overlooked.
Noise discipline: Your equipment must not bang,
squeak, or rattle. Water canteens must 
no gurgle. NO TALKING! Use hand signals or low
whispers.
Light discipline: No flashlights, matches, or cell
phones at night. When absolutely 
necessary, red lens lights can be used under a tarp
or low in bushes just long enough to 
read a map, fix a weapon, or render first aid.
Time selection: If you can do so, select a time to
move through an area that will be best 
for you. Maybe there is more noise to cover your
movement at a certain time. Maybe it 
is foggy in the morning. Is there a full moon? How
will the sun’s location affect your 
visibility? Night or day?
Route selection: Route selection makes the best use
of all available concealment, 
including low areas in the ground, foliage,
background, and lighting and of course the 
location of the potentially hostile observers. Moving
through thick woods may give good 
concealment, but make a great deal of noise. Gravel
roads are noisy. 
Camouflage alone will not be sufficient if you fail
to consider these factors below.

Conclusion
Good camouflage and stealth techniques can keep you
safe, prevent the need to engage in 


--- Page 59 ---
combat or flight, and let you get in and out of
places you need to get in and out of safely. 
Learn to do it well.
Good route selection is critical to maintaining
security. Take advantage of vegetation, low ground,

concealment. Credit: Ultimate Guide to US Army

22  �Should real survivalists retreat 
from society and take refuge in 
wilderness retreats and bunkers 
in anticipation of a doomsday 
event?
Literally hundreds of so-called “doomsday” events
have been predicted in the past fifty 
years. They have all come and gone, and here we are.
Dozens of catastrophic events are 
predicted on the internet each week. A wilderness
cabin or a bunker incorporates its 
own set of hazards and vulnerabilities. You may
actually be weakening your survival 
capabilities over time as you use up supplies. Being
able to make a living, raise a family, 
and build knowledge usually involves being part of
society. A successful life is the best 
foundation for building your survival capacity.
--- Page 55 ---
39
23  When is “doomsday”?
The short answer is that “doomsday” is the day when
your luck and survival plans fail. 
Anyone who tries to tell you when the stock market
will crash, World War III will start, 


--- Page 60 ---
or some cosmic-level disaster will strike is
misleading you. The great majority of predicted 
disasters never happened, and the vast majority of
actual disasters were not predicted. 
Doomsday may be defined as a day or period of days in
which the world experiences 
massive death and destruction that leaves
civilization in ruins. The end of life as we know 
it can happen with one catastrophic event such as a
worldwide nuclear war, asteroid 
impact, or in a series of smaller natural and man-
made catastrophes that bring chaos and 
destruction over years or decades.

24  �What are the elements of a good 
emergency plan?
The adage that “if you fail to plan, you plan to
fail” is never more true than when applied 
to emergency and disaster situations where failure
can result in property damage, physical 
injuries and loss of lives. A great deal of attention
is given to what equipment to have (e.g., 
survival kits) and to the specific skills (e.g.,
first aid, shelter building, etc.) needed for 
emergencies. Less attention is given to emergency
planning principles and techniques. 
Government agencies are required to maintain up-to-
date emergency plans for every 
anticipated emergency. The responsible citizen would
be well advised to make his or her 
own emergency plans for those situations. Having the
right emergency equipment and 
skills are important but having a plan for their
effective and timely application is a key 
element in the preparedness triangle.
Plans
What to Plan For?


--- Page 61 ---
Detailed hazard analysis is the first step to
emergency planning in order to identify 
those emergencies that are the most likely to happen
to you and would have the most 
serious consequences for your life, property, and
freedom. These will be different for 
every individual and family. You may live in a high-
crime area, an earthquake zone, or 
downwind of a chemical plant. You may work in a
terrorist target zone or you may have 
personal enemies with violent natures. If you smoke,
a home fire is much more probable 
than a tornado. Consider the things that have
happened in your area. What trends are 
developing in the areas where you live and work?
Consider long-term national trends such 
as economic instability, climate change, and
depletion of fuel and other resources. More 
severe storms, power outages, and epidemics are
predictable events in the next decade or 
sooner. It should be easy to come up with a number of
emergencies you would want to 
have a plan for.
Answering the Questions
Once you have a short list of potential emergencies,
the process of planning for each one 
can begin. Emergency planning is the process of
answering questions before fate asks 
them. These questions are:
1.       What events would trigger the plan? It is
critical that everyone understands that 
a certain event or combination of events will trigger
your emergency plans. For 
example, if the smoke detector goes off, the lights
go out, or an intruder is heard in 
--- Page 57 ---
150 Survival Secrets  41
the house, it should trigger immediate action by


--- Page 62 ---
every family member even if they 
are in different rooms. You are at work while your
spouse is at home and the kids 
are at school. Suddenly there is a toxic chemical
spill upwind of your home and the 
school. Each of you has to know what to do and where
to meet when that trigger 
event happens. When event “A” happens, everyone
should execute his or her part 
of the plan for event “A.” Overloaded hospital
emergency rooms may indicate 
an epidemic. Rising prices may indicate a coming
shortage of fuel or food. Civil 
unrest in one or two areas may indicate a general
breakdown of law in all areas. 
Constant situation awareness of your immediate
surroundings is a critical survival 
skill, but situation awareness of national economic,
political, and environmental 
conditions is equally important.
2.       What actions are required in what order?
This is the most complicated part 
of your plans. You must cover all the critical
actions but keep it simple and fast. 
The first element of the plan must be to stop or
escape the immediate danger. 
This could be escaping from a home fire, taking
shelter from a tornado, or 
calling 911. Gathering critical emergency items for
continued survival would 
be next. You may need respirators, protective
clothing, medical supplies, or 
weapons to stay alive. Having survived the immediate
threat and provided 
protection against hazards, your next priority is
reaching and gathering your 
family and providing continued safety. Having
assembled loved ones and 
equipment, you can move on to long-term survival
activities as needed. In the 


--- Page 63 ---
event of a home fire, escape and gathering of the
family is probably all that is 
needed. Surviving and evading civil disturbance in
your community or large-
scale epidemic (for example) would require a series
of additional actions such 
as preparing the home for defense and fire
extinguishing or gathering survival 
packs and following a preplanned route to safety.
3.       Where will you be and where will you go?
Obviously your location when 
disasters strikes will greatly affect your planning.
A plan to react to a nuclear, 
biological, or chemical attack will be very different
if you are at work or on 
the road than if you are at home. You also have to
consider both your primary 
shelter or escape destination, and your main
rendezvous location where you 
will meet others and access your survival equipment.
You may have selected a 
number of temporary storm or blast shelters
(culverts, basements, etc.) along 
your daily route. You can stay in these places with
your small survival items for 
a few days and then make your way to your home or
other long-term shelter. 
Never assume that everyone will be at home and have
access to all your supplies 
when disaster strikes!
Note: Use Google Earth to trace potential escape and
evacuation routes. If 
possible walk, drive, or bike to the most probable
routes.
--- Page 58 ---
42  James C. Jones
4.       Who is responsible for what actions? In any
emergency, it is critical that 


--- Page 64 ---
everyone does his or her job. Who locks up the house?
Who turns off the gas 
and electricity? Who gathers the children? Who brings
the supplies? Who calls 
911 while who provides CPR? Make sure everyone can do
each job if necessary 
but clearly assign tasks.
5.       When to act and when to meet? It could be
hours or days before family or 
group members can move from shelter, evacuate the
danger area, and get to a 
designated assembly point. You should have several
alternative meeting places 
and a time each day that plan members would be there.
Your plan might say 
that you would meet at the abandoned gas station on
Highway 12 at noon four 
days after the trigger event and every day after that
until all are assembled. If 
that location is unsafe (e.g., occupied,
contaminated) the alternate location is the 
cluster of trees near the Wilson farm.
6.       How will each action be achieved? While some
actions may be self-evident 
(run, hide, carry) some actions may require more
detail. How to crawl out of 
a burning house or specifically what protective
equipment to put on to protect 
against biological contamination may need to be
included. Good training 
requires less detail included in the plan. When fear
and chaos reign, it is too late 
to be reading instructions.
7.      
What if there are problems with the plan? No plan
survives the first few 
minutes of a disaster. Plan on things going wrong and
try to have a plan that can 
get you past these inevitable problems. What if your
route is blocked? What if 


--- Page 65 ---
you have to walk? What if you can’t get to your
survival pack? What if you have 
to evacuate? What if someone is injured? What if you
or someone else cannot 
safely get home? You need alternate plans and backup
equipment to deal with 
these inevitable challenges.
Here are a few examples of basic emergency plans.
Example #1 Home Fire That Started While You Slept
Trigger: Smell smoke; see flames; smoke detector
activated
What Action: Get to floor. Call 911. Test doors for
heat before opening. Escape via crawling 
(route practiced) or through window, etc. Direct the
fire department and inform of 
missing family members. If neighbors not home, run to
the convenience store at corner. 
Note: always have your cell phone, car keys, wallet,
and a flashlight in your bedside 
drawer. You will need these once you have escaped.
--- Page 59 ---
150 Survival Secrets  43
NOTE: A different plan would be required for a fire
that develops while you are home 
and awake. You still need to call 911, but you may be
able to use a fire extinguisher 
if the fire is small. Once the room starts to fill
with smoke, everyone needs to get 
out fast.
Example #2 A Terrorist Attack Resulting in Civil
Disorder
Trigger: Terrorist attack within a hundred miles of
home followed by riots, power failures, 
spreading fallout or epidemics, state of emergency,
etc.
What Action: All members should have access to
personal emergency items and self-defense 
items, and should put on the best available


--- Page 66 ---
respiratory and skin protection. Escape hazard 
areas if possible via railroad tracks, back roads,
and other preplanned routes. If escape 
is not possible, take shelter in a preplanned
location that minimizes exposure and is 
defendable or well concealed. When safe to do so,
evacuate to your home, shelter, or 
other designated location. Persons at home will
establish shelter and defense if possible, 
or evacuate, with as much gear as possible, to
rendezvous point #1. If home has been 
abandoned, others will continue to rendezvous point
#1 and meet there at noon each day 
until contact is made. Recover food, water, and
medical supplies at rendezvous point #2 
and establish shelter until emergency is over.
Of course these plans would probably include much
more detail about the specific 
routes, equipment, and assignments, but all the
basics are covered.
Getting It Done
As Americans, we play all kinds of video games and
watch all kinds of highly unlikely 
survival videos, while we put off real emergency
planning and preparedness. Survival 
planning can be a game for the whole family that will
be interesting and can save lives. A 
family planning session for a home fire, home
invasion, tornado, or even “the Big One,” 
is time well spent. Do not overlook the slow-
developing disasters such as developing 
shortages, inflation, job loss, etc. Plan and prepare
to minimize the impact of these 
inevitable trends.
Critical Equipment
No attempt is made here to cover emergency equipment
or survival kits but obviously the 
availability of equipment must be considered
throughout the planning process. Your first 
plan must be made based on what you have at the time.


--- Page 67 ---
Planning will probably highlight the 
need for additional items and/or the relocation of
things you may need in a hurry. Plan to 
improve, and then plan again. Always remember, it’s
not what you have, it’s what you have 
with you that counts. Pocket items and small survival
kits that you carry must be part of 
your plans.
--- Page 60 ---
44  James C. Jones
Don’t Guess; Know!
How long will it take to crawl out of a smoke-filled
room* to your front door? Can you 
really build a filtered air shelter quickly in a
biological attack? Can you really carry your 
survival gear five miles in an emergency? How long
can you actually hold out in your 
home without access to groceries, running water,
fuel, and emergency services? Test your 
equipment, practice your actions, and test your plan
against the worst-case scenarios.

25  �What items should a survivalist 
keep in a bedside drawer to 
survive emergencies that develop 
while sleeping?
We spend about one third of our lives asleep, so


--- Page 69 ---
there is a good chance that the life-or-
death emergency will strike while you are in at home
in bed. In that moment everything 
will depend on what you can reach right at that
second. Think about it: You wake up in 
the dark and the house is shaking from an earthquake,
a bomb blast, or a tornado. Or, 
you wake up in the dark and smell smoke or noxious
fumes from a chemical incident. Or 
you wake up in the dark to the sounds of an intruder
or the screams of your family. At 
that moment, there is no time to get out your
survival kit or look in your survival manual. 
You may suffocate, be trapped in the rubble, or be
attacked in the next few seconds. You 
want to have only emergency items neatly arranged
there. You don’t want to be wasting 
precious seconds rummaging around for what you need.
First you should have three 
key items right on top of the bedside table. Your
cell phone should be placed there every 
night. Don’t depend on a landline phone for
emergencies. The landline phone may be 
dead when you need it most and you cannot take it
with you if you are forced to flee for 
safety. Your car keys and your wallet should also be
on the table. If all else is lost, at least 
your vehicle will be available; you can also set off
your car alarm as another way to call 
for help. Imagine escaping into the night and
realizing that you cannot use your vehicle 
and you do not have your phone, ID, or credit cards!
In a true emergency, you will not 
have time to go looking for those items.
Here are some suggestions for what should be in the
bedside drawer, besides the three 
essentials described above. You should have a good
N95 dust mask in there. While will 
not protect you against poisonous gases or carbon
monoxide from a fire, it will offer some 


--- Page 70 ---
protection from soot, smoke, and hot air. It will
also protect you from dust in a building 
collapse. Of course, you should also have a good-
quality flashlight, one that is a multiple 
LED with at least three hundred lumens of brightness.
Don’t be cheap on this item. The 
light may have to penetrate smoke and dust. It may be
needed to signal rescuers to your 
location or to blind a would-be assailant. Make it
bright and tough.
You should also have a small, flat crowbar like the
Stanley Wonder Bar or the 
combination hatchet, hammer, and pry-bar survival
tool to smash windows, open 
jammed doors, chop through walls, and pry yourself
out from under things. It’s not a bad 
weapon, either.
If your family is spread out in the house, a whistle
and walkie-talkie might be worth 
considering so you can activate the appropriate
emergency plan. If you are fifty years of 
--- Page 64 ---
48  James C. Jones
age or older, you should keep a package of aspirin in
that drawer. Many victims of heart 
attack wake up in the night with chest pain and don’t
survive long enough for help to get 
there. If you awaken with chest pain you swallow the
aspirin immediately and call 911. 
Your chances are significantly improved.
Last, but not least, it’s important that you have a
defensive weapon. If you have family 
members that come and go at odd hours, you may want
to have a less-than-lethal first-
response weapon such as a police-size, 200-gram
pepper spray or a Taser. The choice of 
lethal weaponry is up to you, but it must be
reliable, handy, and easy to use. A .38-caliber 


--- Page 71 ---
revolver is one good, simple, and reliable choice.
Anything in a good-quality, .40- or 
.45-caliber auto pistol should do well. In this case,
you don’t need to put out lots of 
rounds of high-velocity, high-penetration rounds. You
need to stop one or two intruders 
in close quarters without shooting family members and
neighbors in adjoining rooms or 
houses. If you wear glasses, keep them there along
with your wallet. These are items you 
will need to survive. You may want to throw in a few
light sticks and a good knife.
Bedside drawer with rescue tool, respirator, aspirin,
flashlight, whistle, pepper spray, and firearm. Cell 
phone, car keys, and wallet are essential needs once
you have escaped. Note the automatic weather alert 
radio on the nightstand. 
--- Page 65 ---
49
26  �How can I survive a period of civil 
disorder?
Rioting and looting are usually limited to high-
population, commercial districts (stores), 
and government facilities (city hall, police, etc.)
and nearby areas. Areas that are strictly 
residential or industrial are usually not directly
affected. If you live in one of the vulnerable 
areas, your best option is to get out ahead of the
event since your chances of stopping 
a mob, and the fires that they will start, are slim
to none. It is a good idea to avoid 
residing or being employed in such areas to begin
with. You should have plans and routes 
of escape, and plans and routes to get home that
avoid population-dense, commercial 
and governmental areas. Public transportation and
major expressways are also targets for 
violence and should be avoided. Outside the violence


--- Page 72 ---
and chaos of the riot zones, there 
are three effects that spread into adjoining
communities.
Spreading Crime and Roaming Gangs
Since the police would be completely occupied or
disabled in these circumstances, 
individual criminals and gangs will take the
opportunity to commit acts they may not 
have contemplated in normal times. Carjacking, rape,
robbery, and other crimes will 
increase. Stay off the streets! Burglaries, home
invasions, and arson will increase as well. 
Stay home and be ready to respond. Your ability to
stay home and defend your residence 
for extended periods is the most important survival
capacity of all.
Spreading Fires
Uncontrolled fires from looted stores and business
may spread to adjoining residential 
areas. Even small fires in homes that would normally
be controlled by the fire department 
can engulf whole communities when the fire department
is not available. This is especially 
true in closely packed homes and apartment complexes.
Obviously, you need to be able to 
put out your own fires and extinguish embers, but you
must also consider evacuation well 
in advance of a spreading conflagration. Mass fires
and even firestorms can sweep away 
whole communities in minutes. Get out of the downwind
path and seek lakes, rivers, and 
open areas clear of flammable and combustible
materials.
Loss of Services
People who become ill or are injured will not be able
to get an ambulance or reach a 
hospital. In some cases, the fires may knock out
power lines. Additionally, police and fire 
services will be overwhelmed and may be unable to
respond to normal crimes or home 


--- Page 73 ---
fires. Water service and trash pickup will also be
interrupted. Such conditions can last for 
several days or longer. You must be able to get along
without outside services for at least 
a week or two.
--- Page 66 ---
50
27  �What kinds of protection should 
I have to prevent personal 
contamination from chemical and 
biological agents, and radioactive 
fallout?
Military and industrial protective gear is designed
for fighting or working in a contaminated 
environment for extended periods. A survivalist’s
priority is to minimize exposure, get 
out of the contaminated area, and decontaminate as
effectively as possible. N95 dust/
mist respirators are adequate protection from most
biological pathogens, toxic dusts, and 
radioactive dust. You can purchase N95 masks that
have a charcoal-impregnated layer to 
provide short-term protection from some chemical
agents as well. These masks are cheap 
and small enough to have in your pockets, purse, and
every survival kit or pack.
These respirators only provide protection when fitted
properly. Follow the 
manufacturer’s instruction. Respirators will not be
effective over heavy facial hair. The 
wearer must be clean-shaven.
Homemade Mask for Biological Agents
Mix 1 tbsp. of bicarbonate of soda to 1 cup of water.
Mix the solution well and soak 
a cloth or handkerchief in it. Wring out till damp
and secure over nose and mouth.


--- Page 74 ---
--- Page 67 ---
150 Survival Secrets  51
After keeping the contaminants out of your lungs, you
must also keep them off your skin 
and clothing. Chemical protective suits are sold in
most home improvement stores for 
use when painting or working in dusty areas. These
should be included in every survival 
pack. Along with the dust masks and some extra pairs
of light rubber gloves, having a 
protective suit will allow you to have a good defense
while you evacuate the hazard zone.
Cheap Tyvek suit.
In some cases, you may not have access to your
protective clothing and masks. In such 
instances, the survivalists’ “better than nothing
rule” applies. Wet rags, bandanas, or 
even paper towels will help keep contaminants out of
your lungs. Rain ponchos, plastic 
tarps, or large plastic bags can also be used to
minimize skin and clothing contamination.
If you are decontaminating an exposed 
person, or treating an infected person, wearing a 
disposable Tyvek suit over your clothing, along 
with gloves and mask, may be necessary. The 
suit can be peeled off, thus avoiding contact 
with the skin and clothing, or decontaminated 
prior to removal. The mask and gloves should 
come off last.
Testing various improvised protective suits. 
The one on the left is composed of several 
different sizes of trash bags.

52
28  �If I become contaminated 
by biological, chemical, or 
radiological materials, how can I 
safely decontaminate myself?


--- Page 75 ---
Having kept the contaminates out of your lungs and
off your skin long enough to 
reach an uncontaminated area, you need to be able to
remove the contamination and 
contaminated coverings without transferring it back
into and/or onto your body. This 
process is called decontamination. Of course, we want
to do this when we are outside 
the danger zone or at the entrance to more effective
shelter (underground and enclosed 
from biological or chemical) locations. Ideally this
is a two-person job, with both wearing 
protective clothing. It should be done in a location
that will not permit contaminated 
runoff, spray mists, or dusts to contaminate other
safe areas.
There are five steps to effective decontamination:
1.       Gross decontamination involves simply
brushing off or rinsing off any surface 
contaminants, as well as dumping any contaminated
gear that will not be 
needed.
2.       Thorough decontamination is 
accomplished by the use of pressurized 
water (not high pressure) with a 
neutralizing or disinfecting solution. 
A 10 percent bleach/water solution is 
best for biological contaminants. Soap 
and water will clear most chemical 
and fallout materials. Plain water 
used copiously will be less effective, 
but may be adequate. The best device 
for spraying is a commercial pump 
garden sprayer. Keep a clean one 
handy at home. They are also good for fighting small
class “A” fires and for 
accomplishing general hygiene tasks.
3.       Next you need to peel off the protective
clothing, minimizing any contact with 
the clean clothing and skin underneath. Step out of


--- Page 76 ---
the foot coverings onto an 
uncontaminated surface. Remove the face mask and then
peel off the gloves.
Typical garden sprayers are handy for 
decontamination and for class “A” fire-
extinguishing tasks. 
--- Page 69 ---
150 Survival Secrets  53
Always bag contaminated gloves, masks, and 
clothing as they are removed.
If any of your clothing or shoes have been 
contaminated, they will need to be discarded 
and replaced. If this is not possible, you must 
thoroughly wash them with strong soap and water 
while wearing gloves and respiratory protection.
Degloving procedure. At no time does the 
hand contact the outside of the glove. 
Thorough handwashing should still follow 
degloving to assure safety. 
--- Page 70 ---
54
29  �What kind of weapons should 
a survivalist have for home 
defense?
The choice of an appropriate and effective weapon for
home defense against criminals 
is as important as it is difficult. It must be
effective enough to stop or deter an assailant 
or intruder. It must also be reliable enough to
function without much maintenance or 
practice, and it must be small enough for quick
access and use within the confines of 
a home. It must not be so powerful that bullets will
penetrate walls and injure persons 
within the house or even outside.
If you are an experienced and trained shooter, then


--- Page 77 ---
you can probably have a larger 
caliber, semiautomatic pistol, but if you are not
able to practice much and/or handle 
the recoil, you should probably stick with a good
brand .38-caliber revolver. These are 
easy to use, very reliable, and easy to maintain.
Using special home-defense ammunition 
specifically designed to stop the target without
penetration and hitting others is 
recommended.
Anyone who thinks my child does not know where I hide
my gun, or my child knows 
better than to play with guns is likely a fool. Kids
will find it and they will play with it. If 
you have children, consider the risk versus the
defensive benefits. Use a trigger lock or 
combination lockbox, or consider alternative large
pepper spray or Taser guns.
The .40-caliber Glock 23 automatic pistol with the
attached laser pointer and strobe light is an ideal
home 
defense weapon. The snub-nosed Colt .38-caliber
revolver is also an effective and reliable option.
--- Page 71 ---
55
30  �Should a survivalist practice 
vegetable gardening?
Many survivalists live in locations where gardening
is impractical, but growing edible 
plants is certainly a core survival practice. Those
who grow vegetables for themselves are 
maintaining a bit of independence and survivalist
thinking, even if they do not think 
of it that way. A small plot in the backyard, or even
a few tomato plants in pots, is a 
foundation for food freedom. Gardening does take some
skill, so practice time and/or 
gardening classes are a good investment. The money


--- Page 78 ---
saved on growing vegetables can free 
up funds for other survival needs. If you maintain a
stock of vacuum-packed seeds and 
fertilizers, you can quickly expand your small garden
into a significant source of food and 
trade goods if food shortages and rationing develop.
While all vegetables are helpful, the less perishable
root crops such as beets, turnips, 
potatoes, and carrots and dryable crops such as beans
and peas are best for survival 
planning. Unless you have a truly large area to plant
crops in, the best method for getting 
the most food out of the least area is a raised bed
in a square-foot intensive garden.
A small raised-bed garden. Note the walkways between
the four-foot-by-four-foot beds for easy weeding and 
harvesting. The PVC arches provide support for wire
and netting to protect against animals and birds.
These 
arches also can support clear plastic to facilitate
early planting and tarps to protect against early
frosts. 
--- Page 72 ---
56
31  �What do I need to know to survive 
a flood?
You need to determine if a flood is a possibility for
you. If your area has ever flooded 
before or floods have come close to your location,
then you need a plan. An increasingly 
unstable climate has resulted in flash flooding of
areas that have never had flooding in 
the past. So-called two-hundred-year floods have been
happening much more frequently. 
Flood-control plans for these events have often
failed. Massive rainstorms have inundated 
even elevated areas. Storm surges can wipe out
coastal areas. No one is completely safe 


--- Page 79 ---
from flooding possibilities.
•       
Maintain vigilance on weather predictions and river
levels.
•       
Keep your survival packs, important documents, and
valuables in waterproof tote 
bins ready to load and go. Preselect routes of escape
that avoid low-lying areas.
•       
If flooding or a storm surge is imminent, close up
your home and evacuate 
beforehand.
•       
If this is not practical, move the elderly and
children to safer areas so they do 
not inhibit your survival actions.
•       
Place your valuables and survival gear in your
vehicle and be ready to drive out 
of danger immediately. Park other vehicles in safe
uphill areas well in advance.
•       
If flooding is a high probability you may be wise to
invest in a small boat or 
inflatable raft that can be used to float out or
carry your possessions as you 
wade to safety.
All that remains of a house after the gas line
ruptured during a flood. 
The explosion also destroyed three adjoining houses. 
--- Page 73 ---
150 Survival Secrets  57
•       
Have a method of evacuation for your pets which
provides for them once you 
are out of the flooded zone.
•       


--- Page 80 ---
Turn off your gas at the meter and your electricity
at the main breaker before 
the flood gets to your home or before you evacuate.
Failure to do so may result 
in a fire or explosion that will level your home
completely.
When the flooding subsides, massive cleanup starts.
All contaminated carpeting, drywall, 
paneling, furniture, and other items must be
discarded. A 10 percent bleach and water 
solution sprayed from a garden sprayer must be
applied to all contaminated surfaces to 
prevent mold and contaminations. Avoid contact with
floodwaters. Wear gloves and 
N95 respirators. Wash thoroughly with soap and water
after contact with floodwater-
contaminated materials. Be vigilant for looters and
do not fall for unlicensed repair 
contractors that push you to sign up for repair work.

The water is gone, but everything is lost. The

32  �What are the two classifications 
of disasters that a survivalist 
needs to be ready for?
While most people think disasters and emergencies as
highly visible, immediate events, 
in reality they can happen over seconds, days, weeks,
or even years. Either way, if they 
are not recognized, they can bring doomsday upon
those unprepared or in denial about 
the challenges.
Acute or Fast Disasters
These are easily recognized as bad and harmful events


--- Page 81 ---
or imminent dangers that we 
must quickly recognize and react to in order to
survive. These include explosions, 
assaults, storms, floods, rapidly spreading
epidemics, civil disorder, economic collapses, 
cyberattacks, and loss of electricity or water
services. These are the kinds of events that 
your survival plans, preparations, and supplies need
to be ready for. You need to be 
ready to pivot from normal life to survival mode
quickly, no matter where you are. Since 
these events happen with little or no warning, you
must be ready to get through the first 
seconds and minutes with your skills and what you may
have with you.
Chronic Disasters
These are slow-developing, persistent, or repetitive
conditions that lead to inevitable 
physical, economic, and social devastation. Such
trends are harder to recognize and easier 
to ignore or deny. Expanding populations are
outstripping supplies of fuel, food, water, 
and other critical resources. Most economies are
running on unsustainable debt. Massive 
poverty, hunger, and unrest are spreading from third-
world countries. Climate change 
is generating floods, famine, drought, and
increasingly violent storms. Things crumble 
instead of crash. Such subtle worsening requires the
survivalist to be ready for disasters 
while adapting to the shifting conditions of life. Of
course the ability to adapt to and even 
take advantage of changes is a prime survival trait.
A combination of frequent local or reginal acute
disasters can actually be part of a 
chronic disaster. For example: the costs of terrorist
attacks and security combined with 
the costs of increasing climate-related disasters are
significant factors in eroding and 
weakening the economy. Declining economies are


--- Page 82 ---
forcing cuts in fire, police, and EMS 
budgets, which further weakens our capacity to
survive a disaster.
--- Page 75 ---
59
33  �Is hoarding justified in 
anticipation of a disaster?
The true survivalist anticipates disasters more
quickly and accurately than average people. 
Those who are in denial or denigrate survivalists
make their own choices. Being smart 
and prepared deserves the reward of having what you
need. Better to have too many 
supplies than not enough in any situation. If the
former, you then have the option of 
sharing if you can with those you want to help most.
This particularly applies to food 
and medical supplies.
--- Page 76 ---
60
34  �What is the most important rule of 
survival?
Certainly the most important of all survival rules is
“never give up.” People have survived 
the most seemingly impossible survival situations.
When all else fails, hope still works. 
Hang on long enough and help may arrive or a
situation may change. Just try to think of 
it as one more step, one more breath, one more try.
Your survival is important to others. 
It is absolutely amazing what the determined human
body and mind can survive and 
recover from. There is an “I” in survival; it stands
for “I can,” “I will,” “I care,” and “I am 
responsible.” Remember that.


--- Page 83 ---
--- Page 77 ---
61
35  �What must a survivalist do to 
manage any survival challenge?
The self-indulgent “why me?” attitude is
counterproductive to a survival situation. Once 
you realize that you are in a dangerous situation,
own it. Think this is my forest, this is my 
disaster zone, and this is my problem that I must
deal with, using what I know and what I 
have. You are never lost because you are right there.
You are never alone because you are 
here now and ready to own any situation.
--- Page 78 ---
62
36  �Is it important for the survivalist 
to be capable of administering 
first aid?
Acquiring first aid skills and supplies should be
considered the first priority in any 
survival preparedness program. A serious injury can
disable or kill you and your loved 
ones faster than lack of water, food, or shelter. You
are far more likely to need medical 
skills and supplies than armed or unarmed defensive
skills and equipment. There are 
three imperatives for every family that a survivalist
must consider:
1.       Every scenario for disasters of any kind
involvers a dramatic increase in the 
potential for serious injury and/or illness. This
includes wounds, infections, 
burns, communicable diseases, poisoning, cold and
heat exposure, and more.
2.       None of these scenarios involve the probable
accessibility of professional medical 
services.


--- Page 84 ---
3.       Without available first aid skills and
medical supplies, your chances of 
immediate and long-term survival are significantly
reduced.
It would be tragic indeed to die of blood loss,
infection, or another treatable condition 
after learning all those other survival skills and
gathering all those supplies. In addition to 
the three imperatives above, there is the moral and
practical benefit of being able to help 
your family, neighbors, and community. Being able to
reduce pain and save lives makes 
you a valuable asset.
--- Page 79 ---
63
37  �How can I recognize and control 
severe bleeding?
Severe bleeding is a life-threatening emergency that
you must treat as soon as you have 
established that the victim is breathing and has a
pulse. The loss of blood in excess of one 
pint is serious.* Dark-red flowing blood is venous
bleeding and can be treated as second 
priority. Bright red spurting blood is arterial
bleeding and must be stopped immediately. 
Every second counts; hesitation will kill!
Immediately apply pressure with your hand or 
any immediately available cloth.
Direct Pressure over the Wound:
Place any kind of cloth or gauze pad on the wound and
apply hand pressure. If the 
dressing soaks through, pile on more dressings but
never remove the first cloth; only 
apply more. Firmly secure the dressings with tape or
cloth but not so tight that it cuts off 
circulation to the limb. Check the distal pulse.

Tactics, and 


--- Page 85 ---
Techniques (Skyhorse, 2008).
* Critical blood loss is much less for children. The
loss of even 25 to 30 ml of blood can result in 
shock.
--- Page 80 ---
64  James C. Jones
Elevation of Bleeding Limb Above the Heart Level:
Usually used in combination with direct pressure. You
may need to quickly splint limb 
if fractures are present.
If direct pressure fails to stop the bleeding or the
patient must be moved or move on 
his/her own, apply a tourniquet as shown on page 63.
They are seldom needed below the 
elbow or knee. Be sure it is visible and mark the
time applied on the victim’s forehead.
Always carry a large bandana, or one of the many
tourniquet devices, in your pocket 
and survival kits. You may also want to add blood-
stopper compresses or powder. This is 
effective for most bleeding, but usually cannot be
applied fast enough for initial stopping 
of spurting blood where the victim may die within a
minute or less.
--- Page 81 ---
65
38  �After bleeding is under control, 
what do I need to do about open 
wounds?
There are three kinds of open wounds that will result
from violent disaster situations. 
They are: abrasions that only damage the outer layers
of the skin, often referred to as 
“road rash”; lacerations or cuts that go through the
skin and may go into underlying 
muscle, nerves, blood vessels, or even organs; and


--- Page 86 ---
evulsions that partially or completely 
separate tissue.
•       
Abrasions can be treated by cleaning with soap and
water and applying over-
the-counter antibiotic ointment and covering (if
necessary) with a sterile 
bandage
•       
Shallow lacerations can be cleaned with soap and
water and bandaged. Over-
the-counter antibiotic ointments may be applied and
the bandages should be 
changed daily.
•       
Deeper lacerations are prone to infections that may
progress to gangrene and 
death. It is essential that they be cleaned with soap
and water and that all 
foreign material and debris be removed. A syringe may
be used to flush such 
wounds. Without the availability of antibiotics it is
inadvisable to prematurely 
close such a wound with butterfly bandages or
sutures, as this may lead to 
infection. It may be better to cover the wound with a
sterile dressing and allow 
it to drain and heal naturally.
•       
Evulsions are the complete separation of the skin.
This may be as a flap or an 
amputated piece of skin. Cleanly cut avulsed skin
flaps can be disinfected, 
closed, and bandaged in most cases. Completely
separated sections may or may 
not reestablish when replaced.
Basic Bandaging Tips and Methods
Soft-tissue injuries must be cleaned and bandaged
effectively to relieve pain, prevent 
infection, and allow the injured person to continue


--- Page 87 ---
functioning. In survival only 
the walking, working wounded will be able to survive.
You may not have all of the 
prepackaged, self-adhesive bandaging products that we
are all used to. You may need to 
use triangles and strips of clean or preferably
sterile cloth for bandaging. Dressings may 
be secured with Saran Wrap, duct tape, or electrical
tape. Here are the basic procedures 
for bandaging and a few illustrated examples.
--- Page 82 ---
66  James C. Jones
•       
If the wound is bleeding heavily, your only priority
is to stop the bleeding!
•       
Freely bleeding wounds should be covered with a
sterile dressing bandaged in 
place.
•       
Abrasions and shallow wounds should be cleaned with
soap and water and 
covered with a sterile dressing.
•       
For skin flaps: flush with clean water and replace
flap before applying dressing.
•       
For separated skin: apply dressing to wound and keep
skin dry and cool for 
reattachment.
•       
A sterile dressing is preferred, but a clean dressing
is better than no dressing.
•       
Soap and water is adequate for wound cleansing.
Alcohol, iodine, and the like 
are not recommended.
•       


--- Page 88 ---
A dirty wound can be flushed with clean water or
saline (salt) solution from a 
squirt bottle.
•       
Extensive cleaning (debridement) and removal of
debris from a wound should 
be avoided unless medical care is not available.
--- Page 83 ---
67
39  �If I cannot access antibiotics, is 
there any way to prevent infection 
and gangrene in deep wounds?
Dakin’s solution is an antiseptic fluid which was
developed by a British chemist, Henry 
Dakin, and French-American surgeon, Alexis Carrel.
This was basically a one-tenth-
strength Clorox with a little boric acid in sterile
water. They would simply place a tube in 
the wound and run the fluid over or through the
wound. The solution would kill germs 
and dissolve dead tissue without harming healthy
tissue. Studies indicate that solutions 
weaker than .025 percent are ineffective and stronger
than .25 percent kill healthy tissue, 
so a .025 to .050 percent solution is recommended.
The wound needs to be kept open 
and flushed frequently, as the solution remains
effective for a short time on the wound. 
This solution was responsible for a significant
reduction in deaths and amputations from 
combat wounds prior to the introduction of
antibiotics.
--- Page 84 ---
68
40  �Is knowing how and when to 
splint an injured limb an important 


--- Page 89 ---
survival skill?
Any kind of musculoskeletal injury can be fatal under
survival conditions. Extra care 
must be taken to avoid this kind of injury. Being
disabled may prevent you from escaping 
additional danger and inhibit your ability to take
necessary survival actions. Effective 
splinting can partially restore mobility and prevent
additional injury to the limb. In 
extreme cases, splinting may be the only treatment
available in the long term. It can be 
difficult to determine the difference between simple
strains and more serious sprains. 
Even fractures are often hard to identify.
Dislocations of joints are usually very obvious. 
The resetting of dislocations and badly out-of-
alignment bones should be avoided unless 
no professional medical care can be expected or
reached for an extended period, When 
in doubt, splint.
•       
Strains are a stretching or tearing of muscles only.
•       
Sprains are a partial or temporary dislocation of a
joint resulting in damage to 
ligaments.
Both of these can be treated by the three I. C. E.
actions:
•       
I = Immobilize the injured joint with a splint or
elastic bandage.
•       
C = Cool the injured joint with ice packs to reduce
pain and swelling.
•       
E = Elevate the injured joint to reduce pain and
swelling.
Signs of Musculoskeletal Injuries
•       
Pain at the injury site


--- Page 90 ---
•       
Bruising at the injury site
•       
Swelling at the injury site
•       
Loss of function of the limb
•       
Deformity of the limb
Diagnosing Injuries
•       
If in doubt, treat it as a fracture.
•       
Check for deformity by matching the injured limb
against the uninjured limb.
•       
Consider the forces involved (bullet, baseball bat,
fall). Would this likely cause 
a fracture?
--- Page 85 ---
150 Survival Secrets  69
Splinting Procedures
•       
Check for pulse and feeling and movement below the
fracture. If there is no 
pulse, the victim is in danger of losing the limb!
•       
If there is an open fracture where bone is exposed,
stop the bleeding and cover 
the wound before splinting
•       
Splint the fracture or dislocation in the position
you found it. DO NOT 
attempt to realign or reduce it.
•       
In cases where there is no pulse below the fracture
before or after splinting and 
no hope of prompt medical attention, you may need to
try realigning the bones 


--- Page 91 ---
enough to restore the pulse
•       
Anything (newspapers, magazines, blanket, etc.) that
will keep the bone or 
joint from moving is good.
•       
If nothing else is available, splint the injured limb
to the body or uninjured 
adjoining limb.
•       
For fractures, you must immobilize the joint on
either side of the fractured 
bone.
•       
For dislocations, you must splint from the bone on
one side to the bone on the 
other side of the joint.
•       
Always check the pulse below the fracture before and
after splinting. If there 
is no pulse, the limb may be lost and death may
result from gangrene. Remove 
the splint and carefully realign the bone until
circulation is restored.
--- Page 86 ---
70
41  �How can a survivalist obtain 
antibiotics for emergency care of 
wounds and illness?
The availability of antibiotics may be critical to
the healing of deep wounds, burns, 
infections, and the treatment of many illnesses.
Although prescriptions are required for 
antibiotics for human use, the same antibiotics are
available without prescription in the 
veterinary sections of most rural farm-supply stores
and aquarium stores. It is important 
to understand the use and limitations of these


--- Page 92 ---
products.
Alternative antibiotics should never be self-
prescribed or self-administered under 
normal conditions. Antibiotics should be prescribed
by a physician and taken according 
to instructions only. While fish antibiotics and
animal antibiotics are the same as those 
sold at pharmacies, they should only be used for
emergencies when professional medical 
services are no longer available.
The three most common antibiotics are penicillin,
amoxicillin, and cephalexin. There 
are also combination or multi-antibiotic tablets
available under various names.
During a severe epidemic or a general disaster,
hospitals and medical centers may be 
overwhelmed, looted, or even destroyed. In addition
to the effects of a pandemic disease 
itself, other types of disasters such as a nuclear
event, breakdown of water and sanitation 
services, and personal injuries such as cuts and
burns can also result in external and 
internal bacterial infections. Such infections can
overwhelm the body’s immune system 
and develop into fatal conditions. Having a stock of
antibiotics on hand could be more 
important than water, food, and weapons in some
situations.
Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections
such as the flu, and should not 
be used haphazardly as a treatment for frequent minor
illnesses. Alternative antibiotics 
should be used only when no other option is available
and serious infections and diseases 
are evident or imminent. Antibiotics are most
effective against wound infections, various 
types of communicable diseases, and many secondary
infections common in disasters. 
Dosage information can be obtained online and is
based on the type of disease and 


--- Page 93 ---
patient. In some cases the survivor may be forced to
guess; in these situations, err on the 
side of more. Adult dosages of most antibiotics range
from 250 mg to 500 mg, every six 
to ten hours. Dosage decreases with child ages.
Penicillin
Penicillin was developed in 1928. Because it has been
in use for so long, some bacteria have 
become resistant to it. Penicillin is generally
effective against common staphylococcus 
and streptococcus infections, as well as clostridium
and listeria. These common bacterial 
--- Page 87 ---
150 Survival Secrets  71
infections should be anticipated in open wounds and
contaminated water and food during 
a long-running disaster. About 10 percent of the
population may be allergic to penicillin.
Amoxicillin
Amoxicillin is effective in treating ear infections,
strep throat, pneumonia, skin 
infections, urinary tract infections, and other types
of bacterial infections. It also is used 
for some kinds of stomach infections. It has been
used effectively for people exposed to 
anthrax. Its effectiveness against pneumonia and skin
infections make it an essential 
survival medication, since these infections are most
common in disasters and nuclear 
events. Amoxicillin should not be given to those who
are allergic to penicillin.
Cephalexin
Cephalexin is effective against infections of the
middle ear, bones, joints, skin, and urinary 
tract. It can also be used against certain kinds of
pneumonia and strep throat. Cephalexin 
is not effective against methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus, known as MRSA.


--- Page 94 ---
The bottles of antibiotics.
Animal Wound Care Antibiotics.
Most farm stores sell wound care powders and
ointments with sulfa and other antibiotics 
for application to animal wounds. Considering the
types of wounds that a farm animal 
might obtain, these should be ideal for disaster-
related wounds, especially in combination 
with oral antibiotic tablets.
--- Page 88 ---
72
42  �What other kinds of injuries might 
a survivalist encounter during a 
major disaster?
Injuries that are common in violent events include:
bullet wounds that deeply penetrate 
the body’s organs and bones; severe internal bleeding
from blunt-force impact trauma; 
collapsed lungs; cardiac tamponade; avulsed (exposed)
or damaged intestines or other 
internal organs; and large-area and deep third-degree
burns. There is little the basic first 
aid provider can do beyond comforting the victim. In
the absence of professional medical 
help, advanced medical training skills and equipment
may be the only hope. A serious 
survivalist would do well to become a certified EMT
or take a survival or expedition 
medics course to attain advanced skills.
--- Page 89 ---
73
43  �What are the eight vital 
requirements of survival?
1: Will to Survive
If you have not already made the decision to do
whatever is necessary to survive, you are 


--- Page 95 ---
already a victim of fate. Having a firm set of values
and a life mission is critical. You must 
believe that your survival is important to others and
to the future. Under true survival 
conditions doing what it takes may take immense
effort, patience, endurance, and pain. 
You must have a good reason to get through and stay
alive.
2: Self-Defense
Being unable to protect yourself can result in your
death in three seconds or less. 
Everyone should be armed in some way. At the very
least, never go anywhere without a 
knife if possible. Under threatening conditions,
carry pepper spray or a handgun. Have a 
firearm and ammunition safely stored in your home.
Maintaining a high level of constant 
alertness and good physical condition gives you the
best chances to avoid or survive an 
assault of any kind.
3: Safe Air
You can only live three minutes without air, but the
air must be free of toxins, radiation, 
and biohazards as well. Smoke, biological, chemical,
or nuclear contamination must be 
considered. In many cases, N95-rated folding dust
masks kept in your pocket, vehicle, 
or survival pack will be much more useful than a big
gas mask at home. If you want to 
have a full-sized “gas mask” at home it may come in
handy, but such masks are intended 
for long-term survival in a hazardous atmosphere,
whereas your best option is to evacuate 
such an area. N95 masks are adequate for short-term
escape from hazardous mists, dusts, 
soot, and biological hazards. Those masks equipped
with a charcoal filter layer offer 
short-term escape protection from most chemical
hazards as well.
4: Medical Care


--- Page 96 ---
In many survival situations, the ability to recognize
and treat injuries and illnesses quickly 
and effectively outweigh any other survival skill.
Severe bleeding, breathing difficulties, 
cardiac arrest, heatstroke, and hypothermia require
immediate intervention to prevent 
death. Many survival situations result in injury or
illness. Bandaging, splinting, wound 
care, and sustaining hydration are “must know” skills
when no outside help is available.
--- Page 90 ---
74  James C. Jones
5: Shelter and Warmth
Under severe cold and wet conditions you can perish
in three hours or less. Injury and 
illness can also result from rain, exposure,
contaminated air, and falling debris. Shelter 
may be a tent, a storm shelter, a fallout shelter,
shade, a sleeping bag, or cover from 
flying projectiles. If you are breathing, everything
else can wait; seek shelter immediately. 
Proper shelter will keep you dry, out of the cold
wind, out of the hot sun, sealed from 
chemical, biological, and nuclear contamination, or
protected from flying and falling 
debris. In most cases you will not have time to go to
a shelter; you must carry it with you 
or use what is nearby. Think and improvise!
6: Clean Water
You can live for about three days without water.
Store at least one gallon: two quarts for 
drinking and two quarts for cleaning and bathing. We
normally use about 1100 gallons 
per person per day for cooking, washing, drinking,
and bathing, but will need much less 
in survival conditions. Store water in clean, opaque,
food-grade containers. Tap water 
does not usually need treatment, but you can add


--- Page 97 ---
twelve drops of 2 percent tincture of 
iodine per gallon or six to eight drops of household
bleach for long-term storage.
7: Adequate Food
You can (theoretically) survive three weeks without
food. This assumes that you are 
at rest in mild temperatures. The exertions of
survival and evacuation will require far 
greater caloric intake. You also will burn more
calories to stay warm in cold conditions. 
While you may be alive for three weeks, your
abilities to think clearly and act effectively 
will be severely degraded after the first five to ten
days without nourishment. The FDA 
recommends 2,000 calories per day, but healthy people
can survive for a long time on a 
lot less. You should try to maintain a 2,000-calorie-
per-day stock per person for as long as 
you anticipate a homebound emergency. You may have to
compromise on a lower calorie 
intake per day for evacuations where you have to
carry your food. Store canned goods at 
home. Keep dried beans, pasta, rice, instant
potatoes, powdered milk, and oatmeal. Stock 
up on canned meats. For your evacuation kits, buy
dehydrated camp meals, dried trail 
mixes, and jerky. You will need a camp stove and
sufficient fuel for cooking.
8: Effective Sanitation
This often overlooked priority results in thousands
of deaths during disasters. Diseases 
and infections from untreated waste, contaminated
food and water, and airborne 
biohazards and toxins can result in fatal illness.
You must have bleach for disinfecting 
bodily waste, purifying water, and decontaminating
clothing and equipment as needed. 
You also need to have hand soap and laundry soap,
toilet paper, towels, and washcloths 
for sponge baths and decontamination. Insect spray


--- Page 98 ---
and insect repellents are important 
as well. Have a chemical toilet or a five-gallon pail
with a heavy plastic bag for home use.
--- Page 91 ---
75
44  �What is the maximum weight of a 
survival pack?
Most evacuation packs weigh about ten to twelve
pounds. Most reasonably healthy 
people can carry this kind of pack for a considerable
distance without much fatigue. 
True survival packs or bugout bags must have greater
shelter materials, sleeping bags or 
blankets, food, and other items for longer-term and
independent survival. Twenty-five 
pounds is about the minimum weight of such a pack. In
a good-quality pack with padded 
straps and waistband support most people can carry
this short distances between rests. 
Of course experienced backpackers can carry much
heavier packs for longer distances 
without fatigue. Survivalists must test their ability
to carry their packs for several miles 
between rests. If you cannot carry it far enough to
reach safety, then you need to ruthlessly 
cull out items.
--- Page 92 ---
76
45  �What if I do not have the survival 
tools and items that I need in a 
survival situation?
It is important that you get into the habit of
carrying well-chosen, compact survival 
items, but you may be someplace where you cannot
carry what you need or the situation 
may call for items you don’t have such as a weapon,


--- Page 99 ---
shelter, protective clothing, or tools. 
In such cases you must evaluate the potential uses of
items around you and improvise. 
Fortunately nature provides many useful items. Human
habitation deposits all kinds of 
junk and trash that can become lifesaving items.
Wire, cordage, plastic bags and sheeting, 
newspapers, cardboard, rags, plastic, and glass
containers and much more have survival 
applications. Wherever you are, do a “what if?” on
the items you see. Look around and 
think about the various items you see and how you
could use them in an emergency. It’s 
a good mental exercise.
--- Page 93 ---
77
46  �How can I stay calm when chaos 
and danger are all around me?
All humans have the so-called fight-or-flight
reaction to danger. This long-established 
combination of mental and physical reactions is
impossible to completely control. Cardiac 
and respiratory rates increase. Stimulants,
anesthetics, and blood coagulants are released. 
The mind may panic, freeze, or develop tunnel vision
on a single area or factor. Critical 
knowledge and skills may be unavailable as the memory
goes blank. Having anticipated 
the possibility of the event and mentally reviewed
and prepared options is the only sure 
way to minimize these issues. Training is key to
taking the necessary action and applying 
your survival and lifesaving skills promptly.
Hesitation and overthinking can be fatal. 
The training takes over once you start to act.
--- Page 94 ---


--- Page 100 ---
78
47  �In a major disaster, is it best to 
stay home or to evacuate?
Premature or unnecessary evacuation may be the
classic frying-pan-to-fire decision. 
Today’s population faces a complex combination of
disasters and disintegration scenarios 
that make the decision whether to stay home or
evacuate more difficult. While staying 
home may be impossible in some situations, evacuation
has considerable limitations and 
hazards that must be considered before taking to the
road.
A great deal of survival preparedness literature is
devoted to cultivating evacuation 
plans, retreat development, and bugout bags. While
the ability to evacuate is a critical 
part of emergency preparedness, the assumption that
evacuation should be the first 
choice in any survival scenario is flawed. Placing
all your hopes in getting to a retreat 
or cache with the limited supplies that you can carry
is a big gamble. Many people have 
health issues, family obligations, or other factors
that simply prohibit evacuation. Unless 
you and everyone in your family is in excellent
shape, it is unlikely that you can carry a 
truly adequate bugout bag very far if you are forced
to evacuate on foot.
Multifamily or group evacuation plans may look good
on paper, but the complexity of 
travel, communications, and rendezvous under the
chaotic conditions of a true national 
catastrophe may actually increase their risks once
they leave home. Premature evacuation 
may well increase the chances of injury, property
loss, and exposure to the very hazards 
you are trying to escape. Once you are on the road,
you are dependent on just what you 
can carry. Additionally, you are exposed to cold,


--- Page 101 ---
heat, rain, fallout, epidemics, criminals, 
and all of the hazards that you should be trying to
escape from. Your chances of reaching 
any distant (one hundred miles or more) retreat are
fifty-fifty at best.
Many catastrophes will develop slowly. In these
cases, home-based adjustment over 
years may replace the need to panic and run. Critical
needs such as food, power, water, 
police protection, and the like may decline and
become unreliable. Developing the home 
as a base and networking with others to create
alternative sources of critical supplies and 
services (e.g., water gathering, food production,
community defense, etc.) may be a better 
survival plan than heading for the hills.
Of course there are serious hazards to staying home
as well. Your unprepared neighbors 
may gang up on you. Fires may spread through the
community, or roaming gangs may 
besiege you in your home. These hazards are greater
in the urban/suburban areas, but 
these areas are equally hazardous to evacuate from.
Obviously events like hurricanes, 
tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes that make your
home and community untenable will 
require evacuation, but these are regional events
where rescue and support services would 
be available within a day’s walk and recovery would
be anticipated.
The scenario that most preppers/survivalists
anticipate is a massive and general 
catastrophe caused by an economic collapse, war,
revolution, cyberattack, epidemic, or 
--- Page 95 ---
150 Survival Secrets  79
similar event. But their idea of heading out into the
wilderness for sustenance is suspect, 


--- Page 102 ---
as the notion that there is more food and safety in
the rural and wilderness regions is 
highly doubtful. Edible crops in the field only exist
for a short time near harvest, and 
farmers tend to shoot looters. Wild edibles, fish,
and game can be had for a short while, 
but with unrestricted and inexperienced hunters and
foragers roaming about, nothing 
will last long, and you may get shot before you catch
anything. I am not saying that you 
should not have the skills and options necessary for
evacuation. Evacuation has hazards 
and limitations that may outweigh the hazards of
staying at home with your stored food, 
water, and weapons. You must have both options.
--- Page 96 ---

48  �How can I plan to evacuate from 
an urban area during a major 
disaster?
Today’s urban evacuation scenarios are varied and
complicated. Worsening civil disorder, 
spreading epidemics, or lack of water and food
supplies may force you to evacuate after 
a period of days. Floods, uncontrolled fires, gang
assaults, or nuclear or biological 
contamination may necessitate immediate flight with
minimum preparation. The 
evacuation plans must take into consideration your
supplies, physical conditioning, 
family members, available routes, and the distances
to safety and possible locations of 
shelter.
The farther into the urban area you live, the harder
it is to escape. The gauntlet 
of blocked streets, bridges, overpasses, shooters,
civil disorder, fires, and other hazards 
multiplies with every mile between you and open


--- Page 103 ---
country. Areas on the fringes of the city 
or into the true suburbs are far easier to escape
from.
The sooner you move to evacuate, the better. Once
even a small part of the general 
population starts to evacuate, your chances of
automotive movement with a significant 
amount of survival goods is significantly reduced. As
anyone who lives in the city knows, 
even a slight increase in traffic or disruption of
flow brings everything to a halt. A 10 
to 20 percent increase in outgoing traffic, combined
with the inevitable accidents and 
breakdowns, will stop everything. This will be
followed by panic, road rage, and chaos 
on the highways. Unless you head for the hills every
time there is bad news, you probably 
will not beat the crowd.
Evacuation is recommended when the anticipated crisis
will be so severe and extended 
that sheltering in place will not be an option, and
when the crisis will be so extensive that 
outside help or rescue of any kind is unlikely.
If driving your vehicle filled with survival and
camping supplies is viable, you should 
definitely try it. To this end, you should have
supplies in tote bins ready to put into your 
vehicle and go. Of course, you should never let your
fuel tank get below half full, and 
if the conditions indicate that you may need to
evacuate soon, keep the tank full. Every 
mile you can get away by vehicle is one less that you
will need to walk. Most people will 
head for the expressways and main roads that will jam
up quickly. Now is the time to 
use topographic road maps found at truck stops or
Google Earth to locate back roads, 
side roads, alleys, and other drivable surfaces that
may offer clear routes. Rivers, railroad 
tracks, and other features that cross your escape


--- Page 104 ---
path will have only limited crossing 
points at bridges, underpasses, and tunnels. Try to
get past these before they are closed 
off. Once these points are closed and the roads are
blocked, you will have to abandon your 
vehicle and walk. You must be prepared for this
eventuality. All of your main survival 
--- Page 97 ---
150 Survival Secrets  81
supplies must be in backpacks and/or wheeled
carriers. Be sure that sturdy hiking boots 
and all-weather clothing are included in your supply
bins. If water obstacles are likely, a 
canoe or inflatable raft should be included in your
equipment. You may want to carry a 
large bolt cutter in your vehicle for opening gates
to service roads and shortcuts. There 
are going to be many desperate people out there, so
being well armed will be an absolute 
necessity. Getting through an urban area requires
close-range volume of fire more than 
long-range accuracy. You need to quickly disable and
suppress hostile fire while escaping 
the danger zone. Large-caliber, high-capacity
handguns, short-barreled shotguns, and 
carbines are all effective options. Carrying lots of
smoke grenades to facilitate screening 
of movement could be helpful. These are available at
paintball supply outlets.
Escape Routes
Escape routes can make use of any unobstructed
pathway that leads to a safer location. 
Out-of-the-box thinking is good for escape planning.
Each city has a number of pathways 
cutting through the mass of built-up and populated
terrain that can be used as escape 
routes. Refugees in the past have often used sewers,
drainage systems, and rooftops as 


--- Page 105 ---
escape routes. Anyone living in an area of closely
packed homes and apartment buildings 
must have a ready knowledge of routes.
•       
Railroad tracks and abandoned right-of-ways offer
unobstructed paths out of 
the city. But take caution, as walking down tracks is
not as easy as you may 
think. You have to focus on your footing and, of
course, be alert for trains. 
Also, raised rail embankments make you an easier
target for shooters, but 
trying to walk on the slanted side of the embankment
is almost impossible. 
Still, they lead straight out of town and often have
necessary bridges over 
obstacles.
•       
River and stream edges can offer routes, but they are
often obstructed with 
vegetation that may make walking difficult. If you
have or can find a boat or 
raft, they are a great way out of town.
•       
Power-line paths are usually kept clear of
obstructions and often have unpaved 
service roads underneath the wires, but they seldom
include ways for you to 
cross streams, rivers, and other obstacles.
•       
Bike paths and hiking trails and parkways are
becoming more common in urban 
areas. Many of these are networked into systems that
reach well outside of the 
city. The survivor would be well advised to become
familiar with these and 
consider a bicycle as a primary or secondary
evacuation system. Bikes are faster 
and can carry more gear than walking with a pack.
Consider that a lot of others 


--- Page 106 ---
are going to use these obvious escape routes, so
don’t depend on them alone.
•       
Alleys are the preferred routes through built-up
urban areas. Fences, trash 
containers, and garages offer plenty of cover and
concealment while blocking 
--- Page 98 ---
82  James C. Jones
you from the view of many windows. Crossing streets
from alley to alley is 
faster than at street corners, and less likely to be
blocked or watched. Walking 
down the street or sidewalk is just not a good idea
for survival evacuation if it 
can be avoided.
•       
Industrial areas will be pretty much abandoned in a
general collapse. People 
don’t live there and looters will focus on shopping
centers. So going through 
such areas may be much safer than residential and
commercial zones.
Working with Google Earth and taking hikes should
help establish a number of alternative 
routes combining the above elements to get you out of
the urban area
Bivouacs and Hideouts
In the jammed traffic of an evacuation, you may make
five to eight miles per hour driving 
before stopping completely. The average person walks
at about four miles per hour, but 
with your pack, zigzagging down paths and alleys, you
will be lucky to make one or two 
miles per hour. It may take you several days to get
out of the urban environment, so you 
need to consider safe places to hide and rest.
Abandoned buildings, garages, and wooded 


--- Page 107 ---
areas may work for you. Underpasses and viaducts will
probably attract too many others. 
Select locations off the main routes and paths that
offer shelter without being too obvious.
Binoculars and Night-Vision Gear
Two items that can give you a clear advantage in an
urban escape are binoculars and 
night-vision equipment. A good pair of binoculars can
let you see dangerous conditions 
and hostile individuals before you encounter them.
Being prepared to deal with or avoid 
a problem ahead of time is a tremendous advantage.
Night-vision gear gives you the option to move at
night and still see hazards ahead of 
you before they see you. Night movement with this
ability can be much safer than day-
time movement. In bivouac you can see who’s coming
before they see you. These items 
are a must if urban escape is a necessary part of
your survival plan.
Alternative Plans
While survival fiction often paints the picture of a
well-stocked retreat in the mountains, 
which is manned by a highly trained survival group,
the reality is that most of us will have 
far more limited resources and may be limited to what
we can carry to set up a camp once 
away from the city. Once automotive transportation is
stopped and choke points are closed 
off, the amount of supplies one can carry will be
severely limited. Backpacking, biking, 
and camping are advisable hobbies for every would-be
urban survivor. Not everyone is able 
to carry a forty- to fifty-pound bugout bag the
twenty to forty miles necessary to reach 
safety. The two solutions below have been adopted by
many families I know.
--- Page 99 ---


--- Page 108 ---
150 Survival Secrets  83
Solution #1:
Store the majority of your survival supplies at a
friend’s house or in a secure self-storage 
unit well outside the city. You can then evacuate on
foot if necessary with a basic survival 
pack, and reach your supplies in a few days on foot
or by bicycle. Some folks even store a 
second car at a remote location.
Solution #2:
Have a hotel, motel, or campground that you like just
beyond the city. If things look 
dangerous, take your family and survival stuff on a
mini-vacation there until conditions 
stabilize. You can still commute to work if
necessary, but if things deteriorate you have a 
head start on your escape.
Cities and near-suburbs are too densely populated to
be sustainable once the 
infrastructure and civil services collapse. Lack of
sanitation, water, food, fire departments, 
and police protection will rapidly lead to epidemics,
riots, and famine. The city dweller 
must preplan a number of safe routes out of the area
that minimize exposure. Physically 
scouting these routes ahead of time will offer the
best chance of fast and effective 
evacuation to less hazardous locations. Having an
evacuation pack and gear alone is 
inadequate without a thoroughly thought-out escape
plan.

49  �If GPS is not working, can I use a 
map and compass to find my way 
out of danger?
A true survivalist is never dependent on external
systems or technology for any essential 


--- Page 109 ---
survival need. Whether it is to follow a safe
evacuation route, find a shelter, or find your 
way through the outdoors, knowing how to use a read a
map and use a compass are 
important survival skills. A map and a compass should
be included in your evacuation 
pack. Basic map reading and compass usage skills
should be sufficient for most situations 
where trails, roads, and landmarks are plentiful. If
the survivalist anticipates traveling 
deep into wilderness regions, he or she should
consider developing advanced navigation 
skills in advance.
--- Page 101 ---
85
50  How do I use a compass?
In most cases, a compass is not useful unless you use
it on the way into the area or have 
an accurate map with you. If you realize that you are
lost, do not know what compass 
course you were on going in, and do not have a map to
locate where you are, you can use 
it to follow a straight-line course in the direction
that you guess will take you to a known 
road or river that you can follow to safety.
The compass needle or dial points to 
magnetic north, which is somewhat east 
or west of true north in most areas. Most 
maps have compass declinations indicated. 
If you are traveling short distances or 
just using compass courses without map 
reference, then magnetic north is adequate. 
Be sure that your compass is clear of any 
metal or magnetic objects such as watches, 
cell phones, knives, or the like when taking 
readings. For survival navigation a military-
style, lensatic compass is recommended. The 
entire dial turns so the compass is always 


--- Page 110 ---
oriented and easy to use.
Simply wait until the dial has stopped moving. Then 
slowly turn until the bearing you intend to follow is
under 
the front sight. Sight from the back to the front to
see the 
direction you need to go in.
You usually will be starting your route from a road,
trail, 
railroad, or stream. Take a compass course at an
angle from 
that reference line. It is highly improbable that
following 
the exact reverse compass course (e.g., 140 degrees
out 
and 320 degrees back) will get you to your exact
point 
of departure. You will be either to the left or right
of that 
point. It is best to set your return route 5 to 10
degrees off 
to put you at a known direction from your target when
you 
reach that reference line.
A durable, military-style compass like this one is 
recommended for serious navigation. Credit: Air 
Force Regulation 64-4, Vol. 1.
Here a 10-degree right return 
bearing is used. Once reaching 
the road you know that you can 
reach the cabin by going left.

51  �How do I orient a map to match my 
location?
Lay out your map on a flat surface. Place the compass


--- Page 111 ---
on the map parallel to the map 
lines, with the sight end pointed toward the top of
the map. Rotate the map with the 
direction of declination formed by the index lines
and the compass needle to match the 
direction indicated on the map’s declination diagram.
Your compass will be facing a bit 
east or west of the maps, pointing toward true north.
Matching a map with the observed terrain, roads, 
buildings, and landmarks. 
--- Page 103 ---
87
52  �How do I read a map when GPS is 
not available?
A map is just a picture of the terrain. Roads,
trails, forests, swamps, and other features are 
represented by map symbols. These are usually
illustrated on a map key on the edge of the 
map. Elevations such as hill, valleys, and slopes are
indicated by elevation lines. Each line 
indicates a higher elevation. The closer the lines
are together, the steeper the slope will be. 
Map scale indicates how a distance on the map
represents a true distance on the ground. 
For example: 1= 2.5 indicates that one inch on the
map equals 2.5 miles on the ground.
Map symbols are usually found in the key at the
corner of the 
map. They are pictorial representation of features
and objects 
on the ground. Credit: 1952 Handbook for Boys

hills would

elevation. The closer the lines are together, the

88
53  �How do I find my actual location 
on a map?
Open your map and orient it. The top of the map must
always be at true north. Look 
around you. Using the map symbols, you may be able to
recognize sufficient buildings, 
crossroads, and the like and so recognize your
location. If not, you can take bearings on 
two identifiable landmarks such as mountaintops or
church steeples, to find where you 
are on the map.
Once you have done that, orient your map. Then point
your compass at one landmark 
and note the compass bearing as indicated below the
compass sight. Draw a line from the 
landmark’s symbol on the map at that angle. Now, take
a bearing on a second landmark 
and draw another line. Where these lines cross is
your location. This process is known as 
biangulation; if you use three bearings for more
accuracy, it is called triangulation.

54  �What are the three kinds of people 
who will emerge in mass disaster 
conditions?
The three types of people that will emerge more
conspicuously under desperate conditions 
are predators, victims, and survivors. These kinds of
personalities exist under normal 
conditions, but laws and social rules constrain
predatory behavior. Victims are passive 


--- Page 113 ---
and dependent in nature, but are protected and aided
by a stable and benevolent society. 
Survivors are active, creative, and proactive under
normal conditions. When desperate 
situations develop and societal norms break down, the
true nature of people is revealed. 
The traits and tendencies of each type of person must
be recognized and prepared for.
Predators
Predators adapt to existing conditions. The smart
ones will avoid openly illegal actions 
unless they are fairly sure they can get away with
it. However, they have a wide range of 
“safe” predatory practices in politics and business
that are legal but not ethical. Running 
casinos is obviously predatory, as is increasing
taxes to build wealth and power. Selling 
cheap, substandard items to people who don’t need
them is predatory. Any actions 
that take advantage of fear, weakness, ignorance, or
kindness are predatory. Predators 
are found in every facet of our society. They may be
among your neighbors, business 
associates, or local leaders. They are often very
good at disguising their tendencies, but 
little actions and verbal clues should help you
classify them. Any person who will consider 
taking anything from anyone (no matter how little),
just because they can, is a predator. 
A predator is never your friend. He or she will turn
on you if it is to their advantage. In 
fact being a non-predator friend to a predator is one
definition of being a victim.
Coping with Predators
Identify these individuals and make sure they know as
little about you as possible. Keep 
them out of your business and your life. Be prepared
to defend yourself against them once 
a survival situation develops. If they attempt to
make you into a victim, correct them with 


--- Page 114 ---
all necessary force.
Victims
Victims are folks who often talk about how
“everything happens to them.” They are 
seldom proactive or prepared for anything. They seek
security by depending on others. 
They spend an inordinate amount of time and money on
fantasy-based activities. They 
join organizations that offer benefits in exchange
for compliance, such as gangs, cults, 
--- Page 106 ---
90  James C. Jones
and extremist groups. In a disaster, they will follow
orders without question. They freeze 
in a crisis or may panic and become dangerous to
others. They may demonstrate and 
protest about problems they think others should fix,
but seldom do anything positive to 
alter their own situations.
Coping with Victims
Obviously you do not want to become a victim. Victims
survive by freeloading off non-
victims and doing the bidding of predators.
Nevertheless, they may be your relatives and 
neighbors, so you may feel obligated to help. There
are some difficult moral choices here. 
Since you are the provider, you set the limits and
you set the rules. Better you than the 
predators. Of course the line is where they become a
hazard to your family or refuse to 
support your program and rules.
It is important to keep in mind that the survival of
predators is proportionate to their 
access to victims. It is to the advantage of
survivors to educate and convert potential 
victims to survivors when possible. Far better (for
you) that they become apprentice 
survivors than apprentice predators.


--- Page 115 ---
Survivors
Survivors are independent thinkers, disinclined to
follow without justification, and are 
resistant to sales pitches. They value tangible
assets and programs above virtual and 
invisible concepts. They work with people and
organizations, not for them. They survive 
and avoid threats by having a high level of situation
awareness. In other words, they are 
disinclined to rely on technology. They are here and
now. When disaster strikes, they are 
quick to shift from a normal thinking to a survival
mode. They anticipate trouble and 
take necessary precautions. For these reasons they
seldom have accidents and are usually 
secure in life. They eschew triviality in favor of
constructive and educational activities. 
Most importantly, they always finish difficult but
necessary activities such as enduring 
cold or heat; burning furniture to keep warm; being
exposed to blood, vomit, and filth to 
care for injuries and illnesses; or abandoning a home
or vehicle to escape hazards.
Coping with Survivors
Hopefully you are, or are becoming, a survivor. So
for you, coping is the challenge of 
becoming better at surviving and making sure that
your family is on the right track for 
the future. You do not need to cope with other
survivors as much as you need to network 
with them and become mutually supportive. Survivors
are going to be overwhelmed 
by victims and attacked by predators. In many places
in the world survivors have been 
suppressed or driven out, leaving a predator/victim
society. Survivalists may be the only 
thing that prevents that from becoming a worldwide
phenomenon. In the words of 
Edmund Burke, “All that is required for evil to
triumph is for good men do nothing.” 


--- Page 116 ---
Hopefully you are doing something now.

91
55  �What are some items that should 
not be left out of a survival pack?
There are some items that are often left out of
survival packs and kits. Years of experience 
have shown the importance of including these items.
Spare Glasses
If you need glasses for normal activities, you must
include an extra pair in your survival 
pack. You may not have your primary glasses with you
when you grab the pack, or your 
glasses may be broken or lost under survival
conditions. The ability to read and perform 
detailed tasks will be important throughout your
survival challenges. You can put that 
older prescription pair or just some generic reading
classes in the pack. A good magnifying 
glass is helpful as well.
Survival Handbook
Unless you are very well trained in all aspects of
survival and first aid, a small survival 
manual or a set of survival cards that include first
aid instructions is helpful.
Binoculars or Monocular
Being able to see trouble or aid is a tremendous
advantage. Finding safe routes and 
campsites at a distance is a big help while
evacuating. Spotting and identifying hostile 
persons or groups before they see you could be
lifesaving. Don’t leave home without optics.
Dental kits or Denture-Repair Kits
Dental care is an essential survival need. The wise
survivalist should maintain dental care 
while they can. Once disaster strikes, a cavity, lost
filling, or infection can lead to pain 
and other health issues. Toothache kits are available


--- Page 117 ---
at most pharmacies. They usually 
include temporary filling materials and topical pain
relievers. If you have dentures, there 
are denture-repair kits available at pharmacies that
can be used to make some repairs. 
Of course, if you do have an old pair of dentures,
they may be worth packing in the kit.
Sewing Kits
Small sewing kits are found in convenience stores or
can be made up at home to include 
safety pins, thread, needles, buttons, fabric glue,
and patches. Survival packs leave limited 
room for extra clothing. Extra underwear and socks
are about all you can pack. The 
clothing you wear will take hard use and may not be
replacable for a long period of 
--- Page 108 ---
92  James C. Jones
time. The kit allows for basic repair of clothing as
well as shelters and sleeping bags and 
blankets.
Chemical Protective Suits
These cheap coverall suits are sold in home
improvement stores for use in painting and 
other messy tasks. They offer protection from
biological, radiological, and chemical 
contamination, but also provide a very lightweight,
low-cost clothing option if your 
primary clothing becomes wet or contaminated. You can
wear the suit while you dry 
and/or clean your clothes. It also provides an over-
suit for additional warmth if needed.
Fishing Kit
Most purchased, prepackaged fishing kits include a
knife, some kind of pole device, and 
floats. These items take up room and add weight. You
should already have a knife in the 
survival pack and the other items can usually be


--- Page 118 ---
improvised from branches and wood 
chips. You do need to pack plenty of fishing line,
some lead sinkers, and a variety of 
hooks. Artificial bait and small lures may be added
as well.
AM/FM/WB Radio
Even if civilization has disintegrated, you need to
know what is going on and where. 
Some stations will be on even in the most severe
situations. Knowing when it’s safe to 
return and where not to go will always be critical.
Knowing what the weather will be 
tomorrow can definitely save your life. Fortunately
you can now buy affordable, small 
solar- and crank-powered radios that have AM/FM and
weather band capabilities. Some 
even offer citizens’ band and shortwave reception.
This is a must-have item for every 
survival or evacuation pack.
Smoke Bombs
Smoke bombs are seldom thought of as a survival pack
item. These can be used to attract 
help when needed or to provide a diversion or
smokescreen to facilitate escape. You can 
buy fused, multi-colored smoke bombs at fireworks
stores, or pull-ring-activated smoke 
bombs from paintball game suppliers. Smoke bombs
ranging from 25,000 to 75,000 
square feet of smoke output are most effective.
Vendors of survival gear make cool-
burning smoke bombs that are advisable for use in
urban areas and dry woods.
Knife Sharpeners
Some survival knives include a sharpening stone, but
if yours does not, you should include 
a sharpening device that contains a coarse- and fine-
sharpening apparatus. Extended use 
of your knives and hatchets will make this a survival
necessity.

56  �What are unsafe mental states 
that affect how people handle 
high-stress events?
In high-stress situations, our minds react in ways
that increase the risks of making 
poor decision or suffering faulty judgment, just when
you can least afford these errors. 
Training, survival knowledge, and common sense can be
abrogated by being in these 
unsafe mental states.
Frustration and Anger
Certainly the results of injury, loss, and damage
from a disaster can make you frustrated 
and angry.
Distracted and Hurried
The immediacy of an emergency can distract you from
other critical needs and priorities.
Hunger, Cold, and Heat
Survival emergencies often involve being cold,
hungry, hot, thirsty, or in pain. Over 
focusing on these discomforts can result in actions
that lead to worsening situations.
Fatigue and Pain
Fatigue is bound to set in after hours and days of
struggling to survive and escape. Injuries 
or muscle aches can also affect awareness and
judgment.
Most of these conditions are unavoidable in a serious
disaster situation, but being aware 
that they are diminishing your mental acuity and
physical coordination is important. In 
survival situations, you may be walking or driving
long distances and using firearms, 
flammable liquids, and sharp tools. You may need to
perform complex tasks just when 
you are least alert. Extra care, step-by-step
procedures, and “safety-first” thinking are 


--- Page 120 ---
more important than ever here.
--- Page 110 ---
94
57  �How can I survive tornadoes and 
hurricanes?
Tornadoes develop with little or no warning, with
unpredictable routes and levels 
of severity. You should have a NOAA weather radio
that automatically alerts you to 
impending storms. Tornadoes move extremely fast and
can change direction without 
warning. If you see a tornado or there is a tornado
warning out, do not hesitate! You 
should already have designated and stocked your go-to
spot. This is usually the center of 
your basement or crawl space. You should have
flashlights, a battery-powered radio, self-
rescue tools, a first aid kit, and other items there.
Bring your cell phone to call for help, 
assuming that the cell-phone towers are still up.
Hurricanes are usually predicted in advance, but
their exact route and severity are not 
always anticipated. The winds can cause extensive
damage to homes and infrastructure, 
resulting in extended power outages. Preparations
include boarding up windows, securing 
outside equipment, and securing adequate water, food,
and supplies for days of isolation. 
Those living in coastal areas or in floodplains
should consider early evacuation. Children 
and the elderly should be moved to safe areas well in
advance. If you are caught at home 
during a hurricane, stay indoors and away from
windows. Do not go outside if the winds 
seem to have passed, as you may just be in the eye of
the storm. Wait for the all-clear 
signal from the radio or emergency services. Be alert
for flooding and downed power

groups part of a militia?
Because survivalists often carry arms, have packs,
and may even wear camouflage, 
they look like militia to the public, but there are
important differences in methods 
and priorities. Merriam-Webster’s definition of
militia is the “whole of the population 
available for the common defense in time of
emergency.” Certainly survivalists fit 
this definition and are well prepared to fulfill
their obligations in this respect. Other 
definitions specify “able-bodied males” eligible for
military service, paramilitary groups, 
or nonprofessional soldiers. These definitions do not
apply to survivalists in general, 
although some survivalists may also be members of
militias of some kind, and so survival 
skills apply to militia training as well. Formal
militia groups usually have uniforms, a 
chain of command, rank designations, and complex
paramilitary training regimens. 
Survivalists tend to be highly individualistic and
less tightly interdependent than formal 
military groups. Survivalists usually do not have
political priorities or objectives beyond 
protection of the life and freedom of themselves and
their families. Survivalists are more 
flexible and less conspicuous than militias, but
militias are better organized. Both kinds 
of groups have their advantages and could be
difficult to distinguish as they cope with 
disasters.

59  �How can I survive extreme winter 
conditions at home?
Fortunately survival threats such as civil disorder
and terrorist attacks are less frequent in 
cold weather, but power outages, fuel, and food
shortages are greater. When balancing 
the hunker-down versus hit-the-road options, staying
home as long as possible may be 
best. Even an unheated house is better than a tent.
You may be able to ride out the 
situation or at least hang on until the weather
improves before evacuating. You must be 
set up to get by without any utilities (e.g., gas,
water, electric) and support (e.g., medical, 
fire, police, groceries) for several months. It is
highly unlikely that you will be able to 
store enough fuel to run a generator and heat your
whole house for several winter months. 
So you will have to adopt a “camp at home”
configuration.
Camp at home simply means that you will reduce your
needs by utilizing camping 
supplies in the home. You can take an interior room
and seal it off with plastic sheeting. 
This will be your one-room shelter for the duration.
You may be able to have enough fuel 
for a small camp heater to help heat one room. Even
better, put up a tent in your living 
room and stay in there. A small tent will be easy to
heat and will conserve body heat 
as well. The best way to stave off the effects of
cold is to eat hot food and drink warm 
liquids. A good camp stove with lots of fuel
cylinders is a must.
Additionally, get good sleeping bags for everyone! An
army-surplus, mountain-rated 
bag is good to about 10 degrees above zero and costs
about $40. For about $180, you 


--- Page 123 ---
can buy the army-surplus extreme cold bag, which is
rated to 40 degrees below zero. Of 
course commercial bags are available at higher prices
with equivalent ratings.
The body burns a lot more calories in cold weather,
so you need to have hearty foods 
stored away. Fortunately the food in your freezer can
be kept frozen or at least refrigerated 
for some time even after the power goes off.
Additionally, you will need to have a strong, 
animal-proof box to store other food outside in the
shade. You can store food in an 
unheated garage or shed or in large metal ammunition
boxes like the ones designed for 
40mm rounds.
If you have a woodstove or fireplace, stock up on
wood. Stoves are efficient to heat 
a room or two, but fireplaces without a running fan
are not much help. You will need 
a good camp heater to keep your indoor tent or sealed
room warm. A Coleman 3000 
BTU heater will run seven hours on one, sixteen-ounce
propane cylinder. That’s enough 
to heat a tent or small room for part of each day.
You are going to have to spend about 
twelve hours a day in those sleeping bags to conserve
your own heat and energy. The 
heaters will have to be turned off when you’re in
your sleeping bags. Even so, you will 
need to have fifty to one hundred cylinders for
heating and cooking through the worst 
of the winter.
You will want to have hand-crank-powered flashlights
and radios, but in the case of 
--- Page 113 ---
150 Survival Secrets  97
winter survival, candles and gas lanterns are sources
of heat as well as light and should be 


--- Page 124 ---
used safely. Keep your carbon monoxide detector and
smoke detector working. Have fire 
extinguishers handy. Avoid leaving unattended
candles, stoves, and lanterns. Although 
the camp heaters and stoves are generally safe for
indoor use, they are hot and they burn 
oxygen, thereby creating a hazard, of which you must
be aware.
If your home gets below freezing for any length of
time, the water pipes will freeze 
and burst, causing flooding. If you cannot keep them
warm, let the water trickle from 
each faucet. If that fails, turn off the water and
drain the pipes. The prepared home is a 
key element of independent, self-reliant survival
capacity, and so abandoning the home is 
always a last resort. This is especially true under
winter weather conditions.
Fireplace with circulating fan, kerosene heater, and 
propane heater are all alternative, emergency heating
methods. Each one has its advantages and hazards.

60  How can I survive an earthquake?
When the very earth begins to move, and buildings and
highways sway, there is no 
escape, but you can do a few things to improve your
chances.
•       
If in bed when the shaking starts, roll out of bed
and lie flat, facedown. It is 
almost impossible to walk or run during a serious
quake. Once the shaking 
stops you can get out of the building.
•       
Do not take elevators after an earthquake as the
shafts may be damaged or the 


--- Page 125 ---
power may fail.
•       
If outside get clear of tall buildings. Facades may
fall off or windows may break 
showering glass and debris below.
•       
As soon as you can, turn off your gas and electrical
supply, as there may be gas 
leakage or short circuits that will cause an
explosion or fire. Inspect your home 
for structural damage or hazards such as damaged
stairways, leaking water, 
jammed doors, etc.
•       
Getting under a bed, desk, or other furniture is not
advisable for earthquakes 
where the main hazard is collapsing structures. If
the building collapses, the 
furniture will crush you. Even a car can be crushed
under heavy debris, such 
as those caught on the Bay Bridge in 1989. The
vehicles and their tires were 
crushed under debris. The safest location is right at
the base of a wall, or next 
to your car, desk, or similar strong object. Yes,
these will be crushed, but not 
flattened completely. Even heavy debris will stop and
be held up a few feet on 
either side of the crushed object, leaving a gap.
This is known as the “triangle 
of life,” and is where most survivors are found.

61  �How can I survive outdoors in the 
winter?
If your survival preparations don’t cover subfreezing
conditions you are only 50 percent 
ready to survive. The great majority of survival


--- Page 126 ---
skills and survival equipment work well 
in dry and temperate weather. In the dry summer
conditions, you can survive for a while 
by simply not doing anything stupid. Moderate
clothing and basic shelter items will get 
you through the chilly, damp conditions of late
spring and early fall. At home, mild 
weather survival focuses on having safe water and
enough food. But winter conditions 
make survival anywhere an immediate and constant
challenge. In winter, Mother Nature 
is brutal. Cold takes no prisoners. The survival
battle comes down to maintaining the 
body’s temperature. This is accomplished in four
ways:
1.       Generating heat internally through the
consumption and metabolizing of high-
calorie food and the necessary water to process it.
Consider this fueling as your 
body’s internal furnace. Food requirements are much
higher in cold weather.
2.       Keeping cold out of the body by avoiding
eating cold food, drinking cold 
liquids, and breathing in cold air that can quickly
lower the body’s core 
temperature.
3.       Preserving body heat. Breathing out warmed
air, standing in cold winds, contact 
with the cold ground, getting wet, not wearing
adequate clothing, and failure to 
cover the head will drain away heat and lead to
hypothermia.
4.       Gathering heat from external sources.
Getting into a warm place, standing in 
the sun, drinking warm liquids, eating hot food, and
standing by a fire, and 
breathing warmed air all reduce heat loss.
Civilizations are focused on providing a warm
environment. Our homes are heated. Our 
vehicles are heated. Even in winter, our exposure to


--- Page 127 ---
cold is brief. Well-fed and warm 
most of the time, we are all in poor condition to
survive long-term cold under survival 
conditions. When we think of survival we think of the
necessity of a fire for warmth, 
but all animals and some human cultures survive the
harshest cold conditions without 
any form of external heat. They depend on heat
conservation and high-calorie food 
metabolism. Two things are certain:
•       
Inadequately fed and clothed humans who are exposed
to severe cold or chilly 
wet conditions for too long will die.
•       
If you live in most areas of the United States and
Canada and have not 
acquired the skills and equipment for long-term cold-
weather survival, you are 
at high risk 20 to 70 percent of the year.
--- Page 116 ---
100  James C. Jones
The body loses heat in five ways:
1.       Respiration: Breathing in cold air, heating
it in your lungs, and then exhaling 
the warmed air back out is a significant source of
heat loss. A simple face mask, 
ski mask, or muffler over the nose and mouth can
conserve some of this heat.
2.       Evaporation: Sweat and dampness on clothing
evaporates and carries away heat. 
Alcoholic beverages give the illusion of warming
while evaporating through the 
skin and taking away more heat. Rain, snow, and even
fog will dampen hair, 
skin, and clothing to take away your heat.
3.       Convection: Air (wind) passing over the skin
carries away heat. That’s great on 


--- Page 128 ---
a hot day, but deadly in the cold. In these
circumstances, get out of the wind 
ASAP! While on the move, wear a windproof poncho.
4.       Conduction: Nature hates an imbalance. If
you are in contact with ground, 
rocks, metal, snow, or the like that are colder than
you are, energy will flow 
from you to the cold surface. Minimizing contact and
good insulation are the 
keys to preventing this heat loss. Wet clothing loses
90 percent of its insulation 
value, with water having 240 times the heat
conductivity of dry air. STAY DRY!
5.       Radiation: The whole body radiates heat/
energy into the environment. 
Adequate clothing is the only way to reduce this
radiation. Since heat rises, the 
head and shoulders are the greatest source of heat
loss, and since the brain is 
most heavily supplied with blood circulation, the
head is the last part to feel 
cold. Further, hoods, stocking caps, and big fur caps
will save your life. Another 
device for combating radiated heat loss is the Space
Emergency Blanket. These 
aluminized blankets can be used as ponchos or rigged
as shelters. They reflect 
body heat back to you. They can also be used to catch
and reflect campfire, 
stove heat or solar warmth onto your body. I have
recovered from damp cold 
clothing in this way.
The two chief dangers of cold exposure are
hypothermia and frostbite. A person who is 
exhausted, hungry, or sick is more susceptible to
both of these life-and-limb-threatening 
conditions.
One of your best options is learning “back-to-basics”
survival skills. Pioneers and 
early explorers survived winter after winter without


--- Page 129 ---
most of the supplies we now take for 
granted as necessities. They hunted, fished, trapped,
and foraged for food. They used 
hides, bark, and branches to build shelters. They
made fires to keep warm. They made 
beds from pine branches, grass, and leaves. They were
not comfortable, nor were they 
well fed, but they did survive through winters. It is
possible to still live this way.
Some of these basic wilderness survival skills,
combined with your pack full of modern 
survival equipment, will allow you to survive through
a winter without additional 
--- Page 117 ---
150 Survival Secrets  101
supplies. I must point out that the having a good
knife, sharpening stone, hatchet, small 
shovel, fire starters (flints, magnesium, etc.),
fishhooks, line, and a small-caliber (.22) 
pistol or rifle in your gear would be essential to
using natural resources for food, shelter 
and warmth.
Conserving Body Heat and Energy
Always be prepared for what the weather could be for
the time of year. Those nice, 
warm fall and spring days can turn into cold, wet,
and windy days that can bring on 
hypothermia in a few hours. Even a summer night can
be deadly for someone in shorts and 
T-shirt. If you exhaust yourself fighting a storm or
you allow yourself to get wet and tired 
before you stop and fall asleep, you may not wake up.
But if you stay dry, and conserve 
your body’s heat and energy supply, your chances of
survival are actually improved. 
Generally, a sleeping person will wake up when the
body gets too cold, and will move 
around just enough to generate a little heat. There


--- Page 130 ---
are cases where survivors huddled 
together under a few tarps or dug into a haystack and
dozed on-and-off for weeks before 
emerging to be found. Therefore, always have a rain
poncho available in your pocket, 
purse, locker, and glove compartment.
The greatest heat loss is through the top of the
head. The body supplies the brain 
with warm blood, and heat rises, so the head seldom
feels cold, but it is sucking heat from 
the rest of your body. The neck also radiates a lot
of heat that can be conserved with a 
turned-up collar, a hood, or a scarf. A wool cap or
ski mask is a must-have item. Another 
big source of heat loss is respiration. You breathe
in cold air that then sucks heat from 
inside the body, which you then blow away when you
exhale. A simple face mask or ski 
mask can help conserve some of this heat.
Additionally, keep a pair of thermal socks under your
shirt when out in winter. If your 
feet get wet you have dry socks. Change your socks
often to avoid frostbite. If your gloves 
are lost, you can use them as mittens. Don’t eat
snow. Dehydration is a real danger in cold 
weather. The humidity is usually low and moisture is
lost through respiration. Plan on 
drinking plenty of warm liquids. Cold liquids will
lower your body’s core temperature. So 
it’s advisable to stop and heat water. Make tea or
coffee if you have it. Warm, sweetened 
liquids will add heat and energy.
Further, avoid long exposure to wind that will take
heat from you by convection. 
Avoid long-term contact with the cold ground or
objects such as rocks and metal, which 
will pull away heat through conduction. Avoid
sweating or becoming wet from snow and 
rain, as this will ruin the insulation value of your
clothing. Avoid drinking alcohol, as 


--- Page 131 ---
it takes heat away as it evaporates through the skin.
Do increase your food intake and 
drink hot beverages to fuel your body’s heating
system. Note that in extreme cold canned 
food freezes solid, and even if heated over a fire it
may freeze before you can get it to your 
mouth. Keeping candies in your pockets may help
provide some nourishment. Water may 
freeze, leading to your dehydration. In such extreme
conditions adding a few ounces of 
alcohol to your water supply may be justified.
--- Page 118 ---
102  James C. Jones
Winter in Camp
Camping out for an extended time in winter is a last
resort. The requirements for adequate 
food, water, fuel, and shelter are much higher than
for mild weather. Most people will 
not be able to haul the necessary weight far from
their vehicle (road). Large groups will 
be able to do better than small families or
individuals under these conditions. Camp 
locations must be selected with care. Select a site
that is sheltered from the wind and has 
adequate access to fuel and water. Cold air travels
down, so avoid valleys and ravines. 
Camp in the leeward side of ridges. If you can build
up a sleeping platform a few feet off 
the ground, it will be five or more degrees warmer.
Underground shelters and basements are miserable in
cold weather. Most camping 
tents are designed for mild weather and are well
ventilated. This is great for hot weather, 
but not so good in cold weather. Look for expedition
or mountain tents that are designed 
to withstand wind, and have smaller closable vents.
Select a tent that is just a little bigger 
than the number of people who will occupy it. For


--- Page 132 ---
example, if there are two people, get 
a three-man tent. Too large a tent will be impossible
to keep warm. Too small a tent 
will bring you into contact with the cold walls and
not let you do anything but sleep 
in it. If you can have only one tent and it is a
warm-weather tent, consider making up a 
cover for the ventilated roof. Better yet, cover the
roof under the rain fly with reflective 
Space Emergency Blankets to reflect the heat back
into the tent. Clothing, blankets, and 
sleeping bags can become damp from outside moisture
and sweat. This causes them to 
lose significant insulation value. They should be
dried each day by hanging them out in 
the warm sun or letting them freeze and then beat out
the ice crystals each day.

62  �How can I make a survival kit out 
of common items in an emergency?
Improvisation and imagination are key elements of
survival thinking. Anyone can put 
together some kind of survival kit from commonly
available items.
You can compile this “poor man’s survival kit” from
common, easy-to-find items. This 
kit is versatile enough to provide protection and aid
in a variety of emergency situations. 
Most of the items included are cheap enough and small
enough that you can store them 
at your office, in your pockets, and anyplace else
you might need them. Most of the items 
listed cost less than a dollar.
ITEM DESCRIPTION

These items were selected to provide the best options


--- Page 134 ---
for the very least cost. Obviously 
items can be replaced with slightly more expensive
items. The whole kit can be kept in a 
small ziplock bag.
SUBSTITUTIONS
In place of the trash bag, you could use aluminized
survival blankets. They are more 
effective for warmth than trash bags, bur less
durable and versatile. You may want to 
replace the razor with a small penknife.
Filter paper is not as effective as commercially
available filter straws that sift out most 
biological and chemical contamination. Another way to
assure clean water is to add a few 
water-purification tablets to the kit for use in
combination with the coffee filter.
You could upgrade from the matches to a more reliable
magnesium fire starter for a 
few dollars more. Lifeboat matches burn hotter and
are better at starting damp tinder.
You could replace the sugar packets and candy with an
energy bar. If fishing and 
trapping are not a concern, then replace the fishing
line with a strong string or paracord. 
Remember that even slightly more expensive and bulky
substitutes may defeat the whole 
(cheap and handy) point of the kit.
ADDITIONS
I set my arbitrary limit for this kit at twelve
items, but there are a few other cheap, smaller 
items that you may want to add. A plastic whistle
could come in handy for signaling. A 
small compass would also be a good addition. A pair
of latex gloves could come in handy 
in a number of situations. You could also add a very
small, single-LED flashlight.
HOW TO USE THE ITEMS
Let’s take a look at some of the survival uses for
the kit items.
Fifty-Five Gallon Trash Bag


--- Page 135 ---
The black bag provides protection against wind,
water, sun, and most chemicals. It is a 
great solar heat absorber. It can offer shelter in
many configurations. You can place dry 
leaves or paper inside to use as a sleeping bag. You
can use the razor blade to cut arm and 
face holes to make a partial rain, wind, chemical,
and fallout suit. Cut the bag open to 
make a four-foot-by-six-foot shelter sheet. When
partially filled with air and tied off, it 
can be used as a flotation device.
Water Still Instructions:
Dig a hole early in the day. Place a cup made from
your HD aluminum foil in the center-
bottom of the hole to catch the water. Place any
available moist plant materials into the 
--- Page 121 ---
150 Survival Secrets  105
hole so that the water can be distilled from them as
well as from the soil. Spread the 
cut-open plastic bag over the hole with some slack.
Anchor the edges with soil and rocks. 
Place a small rock (not too big) in the center of the
plastic so that the low point is directly 
over the foil cup. As the sun heats the black plastic
and the inside of the hole, the water 
from inside will gather on the plastic and run down
to drip into the cup. When the sun 
gets low, you will have some safe water in the cup.
Note that the amount of water depends 
on both solar heat and available plant and soil
moisture. The resulting water gathered 
may vary from a few ounces to a full cup.
Disposable Dust/Mist Mask
These masks come in a variety of styles and are
available in medical supply stores for 
biological protection and in hardware stores for dust
and mist protection. I recommend 


--- Page 136 ---
the N95-rated masks. These are effective against
dust, soot, fallout, biological agents, and 
give some short term protection from toxic chemical
mists. They also can help reduce 
heat loss through respiration and should be worn in
cold weather. They do not protect 
you against toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide.
These masks only provide protection 
if not contaminated prior to use and if properly
fitted and worn. They are ineffective if 
worn over heavy facial hair.
Instructions:
Place the mask over the mouth and nose with one strap
around the back of the neck and 
the other over the head as showed below. Squeeze the
nose piece (if present) to fit snugly. 
Cover the mask with both hands and inhale sharply.
Pressure should be felt inside the 
mask. If not, adjust the straps and the mask, and
test again until pressure is felt.
Laboratory Filter Paper or Coffee Filter
A coffee filter or laboratory-grade filter paper can
be folded into a cone to pour water 
through into a receptacle made from your heavy-duty
aluminum foil. You can then boil 
the water for five minutes in the foil pan to get
filtered and decontaminated water
Pins and Safety Pins
The safety pins have many applications as they are
and can be 
modified for other uses. The fishing line can be used
with a safety 
pin fashioned into a hook for fishing. You can
magnetize a piece of 
a pin by stroking it in one direction with silk or
through your hair. 
Placing the pin carefully on still water out of the
wind on a very 
small leaf or other float it will eventually turn to
point north.


--- Page 137 ---
Floating a magnetized 
straight pin or broken- 
off safety pin on a small 
leaf to determine 
magnetic north.
--- Page 122 ---
106  James C. Jones
Saran Wrap or Similar
A 12 x 24-inch sheet of Saran Wrap can be used 
to cover the eyes for dust and chemical protection, 
or to cover the hands for chemical and biological 
protection. This material can also be used as a 
waterproof, blood-proof bandage for a variety of 
wounds and to hold a splint in place.
Heavy-Duty Aluminum Foil
The 12 x 24-inch sheet of heavy-duty aluminum 
foil can be used as an effective signal mirror to 
get help. You can also place the foil in the back 
of your fire to reflect the heat. You can shape or 
fold the foil into a bowel to cook food or boil 
water. Drinking warm water can save your life 
under cold conditions and boiling water for five 
minutes can make contaminated water safe to 
drink. Aluminum foil is the dressing of choice for 
wounds that expose internal organs.
Aluminum foil can be used as a heat reflector. 
One way to make a cooking pot out of your aluminum
foil by wrapping it around a 
forked stick that is formed into a loop. Fold and
smooth out the foil to make a signal 
mirror. To aim the reflection at rescuers, planes or
other sources of help. Place the target 
between two fingers, then move the mirror so that the
beam shines through the fingers.
THIS KIT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH BUT IT CONTAINS MANY 
VERSATILE ITEMS THAT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE.
The whole kit fits into a ten-inch freezer zip bag
and weighs 


--- Page 138 ---
about 6.5 ounces. The optional items brings it up to
about 
eight ounces.
A survival kit is like any tool. It is only as good
as the person 
using it. Calm determination and an organized
approach to 
managing the situation will go a long way toward
keeping you 
alive in any emergency.
Clear, self-sticking plastic wrap makes a 
good bandage with or without tying and it 
can be used to secure splints as well.
The bag itself has many uses. 
Note the optional addition 
of latex gloves, Band-Aids, 
rubber bands, a whistle, and 
a mini-compass.

63  �How can a survivalist avoid being 
overwhelmed by the challenges of 
a serious emergency or disaster 
situation?
Being lost and injured in a blizzard, or fleeing a
massive civil disorder resulting from an 
epidemic, all while dealing with your own injuries
and lost equipment, are examples of 
survival situations. These situations can easily
overwhelm the senses and create a sense 
of confusion and despair when order and effective
action are most needed. Once safety 
and normalcy have dissolved and multiple hazards are
evident, it is critical to avoid panic 
or paralysis. The survivalist must focus on just one
or two effective steps in the right 
direction. You must just do the right thing that will
get you toward survival, without 


--- Page 139 ---
thinking too much about how many difficult things you
need to do after that. That 
closest or most urgent step may be to put on a
respirator, take cover, get out of the 
wind and rain, or climb one step out of a deep ice
crevasse. Avoid adding additional 
risks or wasting energy and resources, but start the
process of improving your chances. 
True survivalists have used this step-by-step process
to survive extended and complex 
challenges.
--- Page 124 ---
108
64  �How can a survivalist be better 
mentally prepared for any kind of 
emergency or disaster?
Accepting and anticipating that one may be challenged
by an emergency or disaster is 
critical to surviving. Non-survivalists are in
constant denial of the potential for acute and 
chronic disasters even when those disasters are
obviously possible or already in progress. 
The survivalist has already made the transition from
denial through deliberation and 
possesses the mental tools to decide and to act.
Accepting the possibility that bad things 
can happen or are happening to you puts you far
ahead. Having a basic plan of action for 
escaping a fire, or shelter spot if a shooting
incident develops at a restaurant, shopping 
mall, church, theater, or other public area, only
takes a few seconds, but will reduce your 
reaction time if the worst happens.
--- Page 125 ---
109
65  �What is the most important daily 


--- Page 140 ---
practice of a survivalist?
Constant situational awareness is a defining
characteristic of a survivalist. Larger 
survival threats one must constantly be aware of
include developing national economic 
environmental, and social trends. Increasing crime
rates, increasing cyberattacks, 
widespread epidemics, and international tensions all
can indicate future survival issues 
that must be prepared for or avoided.
On a more immediate basis, you need to develop the
habit of observing and analyzing 
things around you and ahead of you. Who are these
people coming toward me? Do I smell 
smoke? Why is that person wearing a long coat on a
warm day? The military calls this 
process OODA for observe, orient, decide, and act.
Failure to notice an immediate threat 
or to acknowledge a developing survival problem in a
timely manner greatly reduces your 
chances to prevent, avoid, or survive it.
--- Page 126 ---

66  �What is the most important factor 
in surviving a fast-developing 
survival situation?
Getting from denial to action is the first step in
survival. Once you have accepted that a 
bad thing is happening or about to happen to you, you
must quickly evaluate your action 
options. Here is where your accumulated survival
knowledge, survival tools, and, most 
importantly, your mental preparations, become
critical. You must not be distracted by 
considerations that are irrelevant to survival. You
must be present mentally. Hesitation, 
distraction, wishing, or agonizing will only reduce
your chances of survival or escape.


--- Page 141 ---
--- Page 127 ---
111
67  �What issue can be the biggest 
challenge and obstacle to 
surviving an emergency?
The biggest challenge in many survival situations is
having to do unpleasant or even 
terrible things. Doing things that are destructive,
nauseating, violent, repulsive, and 
frightening may be the only way to save yourself and
others from death or serious injury. 
Helping the sick and injured may involve vomit,
blood, and other nasty sights and odors. 
Enduring dirt, cold, heat, smoke, and rain may be the
only way to escape. Using violence 
or even deadly force against an assailant or
terrorist is fully justified. You may need to 
strip off cold, wet, or contaminated clothing in
front of others, or chop up and burn your 
heirloom furniture to keep warm. Vanity or normal
aversions must be overcome under 
survival conditions. This is why the military puts
recruits through challenging training 
situations.
--- Page 128 ---
112
68  �What are the four levels of mental 
reaction to threats and dangers?
The four stages of coping with survival emergencies
are relatively well known, but must 
be understood and recognized by the survivalist.
Denial is always the first stage we go 
through when that initial blast, shot, whiff of
smoke, or other indication of danger enters 
our awareness. No matter how much we anticipate or
ready ourselves, we will experience 


--- Page 142 ---
an immediate desperate attempt to hold on to
normalcy. This is known as the normalcy 
bias. We say “oh no!’ or “you have to be kidding!” In
some cases people simply cannot get 
out of this stage fast enough to survive. Only firm
orders or instructions will move them 
to escape. People have been found burned to death
while waiting for instructions when 
most others escaped safely. A true survivalist always
knows that there is the possibility of 
trouble and therefore jumps from denial to
deliberation more quickly. Deliberation time 
depends on the type of disaster developing. A growing
epidemic may provide a few days 
of reaction time. An approaching tornado may (or may
not) offer a just few minutes. 
A fire or a shooting requires that a decision be made
immediately. Having anticipated 
the possibility of such a situation and preplanned
your shelter, escape, or survival action 
allows you to jump to your decision quickly. Your
decision depends on the situation and 
the nature of the threat, but your physical
condition, survival skills, and what you have 
with you all greatly improve your options and your
survival chances. Your actions must 
be swift and decisive. They may also involve some
risks, injuries, and pain. However, you 
do what you have to do.
--- Page 129 ---
113
69  �Are the rules and paradigms of 
survival applicable in everyday 
life?
Survivalists are always successful in life because
they apply the principles of survival to 
everything they do. Those who consistently make bad
decisions and poor choices are not 


--- Page 143 ---
survivalists. Just waiting for doomsday and piling up
supplies is not being a survivalist, 
because you may be failing at everyday life. Below
are the principles of survival, as applied 
to an effective and successful life:
•       
Anticipate: A survivalist anticipates changes in the
economy, personal health, 
employment, the community, and other factors, and
makes adjustments to 
avoid or prevent problems, thus becoming safer and
stronger.
•       
Be aware: A survivalist is aware and knowledgeable
about issues that may 
affect the future and create hazards to prepare for
or opportunities to take 
advantage of.
•       
Be here now: A survivalist focuses on reality and on
what is relevant. 
He or she creates a better life through self-
improvement, hard work, and 
responsibility. Survivalists avoid debt and follow a
“save and buy,” rather than a 
“buy and pay interest,” program.
•       
Stay calm: A survivalist is much less stressed than
non-survivalist because 
a survivalist maintains health and financial
security, and has prepared for 
potential emergencies in advance. They are neither
paranoid nor fearful.
•       
Evaluate: A survivalist constantly evaluates his or
her life situation, assets, 
liabilities, health, and possibilities in order to
make the right choices based on 
logic rather than emotions.
•       


--- Page 144 ---
Do the next right thing: A survivalist knows that the
future can always be 
uncertain, but acts to improve his or her situation
step-by-step and day-by-day.
•       
Take control: A survivalist is proactive instead of
letting life happen to him or 
her. Performing constructive and responsible actions
in order to become better, 
stronger, safer, and more prepared is a lifestyle. A
survivalist is not waiting for 
something to happen. A true survivalist sets goals
and takes actions based on a 
personal mission, not the requirements and
expectations of others.
•       
Have what you need: A survivalist puts realistic
needs before frivolous wants. 
If you truly need something, plan and work to get it.
Balancing quality versus 
quantity, and value versus usefulness, is a hallmark
of a wise survivalist. 
--- Page 130 ---
114  James C. Jones
Impulse buying or rampant consumerism are not
components of survival 
thinking.
•       
Use what you have: A survivalist makes the very best
use of his or her skills 
and assets to deal with problems and build a better
life. Improvisation is a 
critical skill.
•       
Do what you must: Failure to do hard things and make
hard choices always 
leads to failure in life. The harder the decision,
the more important it is to do 


--- Page 145 ---
it. Survivalists do not avoid unpleasant tasks or
procrastinate. You must do 
what you must do!
The true survivalist has a defined mission in life
and sets goals toward accomplishing that 
mission. They are an asset to their community and
family on a daily basis and a greater 
asset when emergencies occur. Violation of the above
principles of survival lead to failure 
in a survival situation and failure in daily life.
--- Page 131 ---
115
70  �What actions should guide the 
survivalist in managing personal 
finances?
Survival mind-sets and strategies can and should be
applied to everyday life including 
scenarios with your family and your job. The same
rules and priorities apply, and the 
same errors and misjudgments will get you into
serious trouble.
We all know that paper and digital currency like
Bitcoin only has value as long as 
the society believes that it has value. Therefore,
you should seek to gather it and use it 
effectively, but only while it has the means to
improve your security and survivability. 
Gold and silver are functionally as useless as paper
in a true economic meltdown. In 
Europe during sieges and economic collapses, gold,
silver, and diamonds were usable as 
trade for a very short time after paper lost its
value, but once shortages developed only 
hard, barterable goods were the only valuable. A gold
watch or a diamond ring may not 
get you a turnip or a roll of toilet paper in a post-
collapse economy. Today’s economic 
survival involves the same issues as a disaster


--- Page 146 ---
situation. There are the same three kinds of 
people in the game.
Economic Predators
Economic predators are constantly seeking to rob you
and control you just as they would 
in a disaster, but they use different methods in an
economic collapse. They set economic 
traps that are baited with false expectations and
useless goods. They whittle away at your 
funds with taxes, interest charges, rents, and
gimmicks. They need to get you into debt 
and keep you in debt. Over the years, they will take
hundreds of thousands of dollars 
from you, for nothing in return. Yes, you have to pay
taxes and other charges, but you 
must get out from under their control no matter what
it costs. Minimize debts and pay 
off credit cards and loans as quickly as possible.
Postpone purchases until you can buy 
without using credit.
Economic Victims
Economic victims are the working poor and those
firmly stuck in welfare systems. The 
objective of predators is to drive more and more
people into these classes where they 
are dependent on the state and/or various cartels to
survive. As victims become more 
and more dependent on these predatory groups for
their life-critical needs (shelter, food, 
water, medical aid, protection, etc.) they completely
lose any pretense of individuality or 
freedoms.
--- Page 132 ---
116  James C. Jones
Economic Survivors
Economic survivors are people who have ignored the
traps and focused on economic 
independence and the key survival priorities. They


--- Page 147 ---
may do with less and appear poorer, 
but they have no debts and have secured their sources
of shelter, food, and other essentials 
above all else. Regardless of future developments,
they will always do better in the long 
run.
Here are a few basic rules for economic survival and
for building economic security. 
These are the foundations for building up you
preparedness capabilities and moving 
toward greater self-reliance as the system fails.
•       
Budget, budget, budget. It is amazing me how people
who have worked 
steadily for many years still live from paycheck to
paycheck. Budgeting is the 
first key to economic survival. Without it you
relinquish control to predators 
and to your own whims and weaknesses. You have to
budget just like disaster 
survival. Shelter, food, utilities, medical needs,
and reserve funds must be 
covered before even considering other priorities.
After these are covered you can 
consider reserves in the form of hard survival goods
(such as seeds, ammunition, 
candles, matches, soap, alcohol, tools, and medical
supplies), education, and real 
estate. Saving and investing are still okay as long
as you don’t put all your eggs 
in one basket, so to speak. Wise investments can
vastly improve your survival 
potential as you apply the gains toward building your
independence.
•       
Avoid using credit cards as much as possible. There
are some places where 
their use cannot be avoided such as car rentals or
online purchases, but 
everyday (groceries, gas, clothing, etc.) purchases


--- Page 148 ---
should be made with cash. 
Take your budgeted money for each expense and use it
with care. When it’s 
gone it’s gone. Credit cards tempt you to spend
beyond the budget.
•       
Ignore society’s values and your own ego and vanity.
You don’t need the 
latest things! You do not need to have what your
neighbors or friends have. An 
older car that is paid for is much better than a
newer one that you are paying 
interest on.
•       
Do without or with less early in life. Instead of
buying newer, better, and 
bigger on credit, buy what you really can afford and
save for better later. Live a 
little beneath your means. You may look like the
proverbial turtle, but you will 
win the economic survival race.
•       
Avoid frivolous and nonessential expense. To some,
the lottery is just 
voluntary taxation run by predators. Drugs are traps
run by other predators. 
Cigarettes are the tools of both kinds of predators.
We all have a few hobbies or 
things we enjoy, but those must be prioritized with
funds after all essential bills 
and some savings are dealt with. As time goes on you
will do better and better 
as your victim friends descend into debt.
--- Page 133 ---
150 Survival Secrets  117
•       
The job comes first. Survival is never easy. If you
are out of work, your family 


--- Page 149 ---
and survival situation deteriorate. Any job is better
than no job. Yes, you may 
have to put up with difficult people and dirty work
until you can find a better 
job, but keep what you have and do it well. That’s
survival! Acting on ego or 
temper usually leads to bad survival situations.
•       
Make yourself a valuable survival asset. You can be
worth more than your 
weight in gold if you have skills and experience.
Take any opportunity to get 
education and experience. Be constantly looking for
opportunities to advance 
your career, but be alert for scams and frauds.
•       
Get on the collection side of the equation. Unless
there are exceptional 
needs, paying interest is the worst way to use money.
Save and buy rather than 
buy and pay. Save money for your first car and then
save until you can buy a 
newer car for cash. Buy instead of rent. If you can
buy a rental property at low 
interest or on contract with the owner, the tenants
can pay off the building 
and all the expense until you can sell it at
substantial profit. Not owing money 
early in life allowed you to save and invest instead.
Real estate has value even 
in a totally collapsed economy. You can provide
shelter, and a base for survival 
business and food production. Investments should
never exceed or endanger 
your home and reserves.
•       
Getting out of debt and staying out of debt. This is
the most important 
survival act anyone can perform. Avoiding wasting
funds on bad habits such 


--- Page 150 ---
as the lottery, drugs, cigarettes, and junk goods is
a revolutionary form of self-
liberation. Knowing the difference between wants that
are established by the 
society and media, and needs that have true value in
survival, takes you from 
victim to survivor.
Risk versus Rewards in Economic Survival
I would be remiss if I didn’t admit that a
conservative, low-risk survival-oriented financial 
strategy has a downside. While it increases security
through tough times and disasters, it 
also means living with less and passing up some
potentially profitable opportunities and 
investments. An occasional small loan or debt may be
justified for education or for solid 
tangible goods, but you have to ask yourself, if this
fails, can I survive and recover without 
loss of my foundation assets? This process is called
risk-benefit analysis.
Conclusions
While prepping may apply to disaster survival true
survivalism is a way of approaching 
every aspect of life. The rules of survival apply to
family life, careers, economics, and 
lifestyles. Your priorities always put life
essentials ahead of societal and culturally 
--- Page 134 ---
118  James C. Jones
promoted values. The application of survival
principles to personal economic planning 
greatly improves your chances of surviving and even
thriving through any level of 
economic decline or collapse. Simply put: the better
off you are financially during normal 
times, the better off you can be materially when
things get tough.

71  �What are the most critical first 
aid skills for surviving serious 
medical emergencies?
Once a serious disaster develops, normal medical
emergency services may not be 
available. In addition to traumatic injuries from a
disaster situation, there may be medical 
emergencies (which can be caused by the disaster)
that are more apt to result in fatalities 
due to the lack of available medical care. While the
underlying causes of most of these 
emergencies cannot be addressed by the survivalist or
caregiver, they can be effective 
in disaster situations by buying time and providing
an opportunity for recovery for the 
victim. Knowing what to do for others is a core
survivalist responsibility.
Recognition and Treatment of a Heart Attack
A heart attack, also known as myocardial infarction
(MI), can occur at any time, but 
is far more probable when physical and psychological
stress are elevated. Those with 
preexisting heart conditions and the elderly are more
at risk. All efforts should be made 
to reduce stress for these individuals and to be
vigilant for any sign of an impending 
heart attack. Myocardial infarctions (MI) result from
obstruction of blood flow to heart 
tissue. This results in the death of tissue and a
cessation of normal heart function. The 
heart goes into atrial fibrillation, which is a
disorganized vibrating instead of beating. 
No blood is pumped and the brain and other internal
organs begin to shut down. If the 
flow of oxygenated blood is not restored quickly,
then death is certain. Effective CPR 
can sustain life for a while but seldom results in


--- Page 152 ---
restoring a normal cardiac rhythm and 
patient recovery. CPR provides a small chance at
recovery, and offers a savable patient for 
the EMS personnel or anyone who uses an AED. The
sooner an AED is used, the better 
the chances of restoring the patient’s heart rhythm.
Cardiac Arrest (Myocardial Infarction)
Urgency
Symptoms of a heart attack include crushing chest
pains radiating to the back or left arm. The 
patient may also be sweating, weak, dizzy, or even
faint. The afflicted person may verbalize 
that they think they are going to die. If it might be
a heart attack, treat it as if it is one.
Action
Your first priority is to call 911 or send someone to
do it. If the person is conscious, ask 
if they have prescription heart medication to take.
Aspirin is a blood thinner and can 
--- Page 136 ---
120  James C. Jones
reduce the severity of a heart attack. If the patient
is not allergic to aspirin, having them 
take two pills may be helpful.
CPR
Most current CPR courses take about four hours, but
learning this skill should take only 
a few minutes. A certificate is nice to have, but
provides no additional legal authorization 
or protection. If you can do what is described below,
you can do CPR.
1.       Check for responsiveness. Shake and shout,
“Are you okay?”
2.       Send for help.
3.       Open airway and perform a head tilt, chin
lift, or jaw thrust (no pulse check).

about five seconds.

5.       If the patient is not breathing, then
initiate CPR

Aid for 
Soldiers FM 21-11.
CPR Instructions
•       
Start at the nipple line (lower for children).
•       
Compress the patient’s chest 1½ to 2 inches for
adults (½ to 3/4 inch for children).
•       
Place hands interlocked, fingers up
•       
Lock your elbows.
•       
Place your weight over the sternum, just 
below the nipple line. Keep your elbows 
straight and locked. Use your body 
weight to compress straight down. No 
bouncing or rocking
•       
Perform thirty hard and fast 
compressions straight down.
•       
Blow two full breaths into the patient’s 
mouth. Tilt the head, then pinch nose.
6.       Continue CPR until you are too exhausted,
the victim revives, or an AED is 
used.
For two-person CPR: use same count (thirty


--- Page 154 ---
compressions, two breaths) alternate 
between compressions and breathing or take turns
doing both.
Note that you should only use one hand for children
and just two to three fingers for 
an infant.
Figure 5. Proper body position for CPR.

--- Page 138 ---
122  James C. Jones
AED
It cannot be said more emphatically. Anyone can and
should use an AED immediately 
and without hesitation on a patient whose heart has
stopped. While AED training is 
desirable, it is not necessary. If you can use a cell
phone, then you are capable of using an 
AED. If one is within reach, just open it, push the
button, and follow the instructions.
Note that if the victim starts to cough and regain
consciousness, roll them onto their 
side, so as to prevent aspiration via vomiting that
could result in further complications.
Recognition and Treatment of a Stroke
A stroke often results from elevated blood pressure,
and elevated blood pressure often 
results from a psychological and/or physical
emergency. This is especially common in 
the elderly, but can affect anyone subjected to
pressure and struggle. Recognition and 
immediate action are essential to the victim’s
chances of recovery. Stroke victims who are 
transported to advanced medical care facilities have
a good chance for full recovery and 
reversal of the effects. When transport and care are
delayed beyond one hour, permanent 
and advancing disabilities are far more probable. If
the stroke occurs in a remote location 


--- Page 155 ---
or when care facilities are not functioning, the
survivalist’s options are severely limited. 
There are three main causes of strokes, but the signs
and symptoms and the required 
actions of each are the same.
Signs and symptoms of a stroke
•       
Partial or complete paralysis of one side of the
body.
•       
Diminished levels of consciousness including
dizziness, confusion, and coma.
•       
Difficulties with speaking and vision.
•       
Difficulty swallowing.
•       
Altered facial expression.
•       
Headache without any of the above other signs.
•       
Convulsions.
Quick diagnosis of a stroke
•       
Have the victim hold his or her arms out to the side.
If one arm drifts 
downward, that is a sign of a stroke.
•       
Have the victim smile. A stroke victim will have a
facial droop on one side.
•       
Ask the victim to recite “Mary had a little lamb,” or
other easy phrases. Speech 
difficulty will be indicative of a stroke.
Stroke care action
•       
Keep the victim as calm and comfortable as possible.
--- Page 139 ---


--- Page 156 ---
150 Survival Secrets  123
•       
Monitor the airway to prevent choking or blockage.
•       
If oxygen is available, use it at high flow.
•       
Continue talking to the victim and monitoring his or
her level of 
consciousness.
•       
The conscious victim may remain in a seated position,
but must not be 
permitted to stand or walk, as falling is a high
probability.
•       
If it is necessary to transport an unconscious victim
on a stretcher, he or she 
should be placed on the paralyzed side.
•       
Do not waste time! Get this person to an ER as fast
as possible.
Note that a sudden severe headache that is centered
at the back of the skull is often 
caused by an arterial rupture and may be followed by
convulsions, paralysis, and loss of 
consciousness. Such headaches should trigger an
immediate transport to the ER.
Recognition and Treatment of Diabetic Emergencies
There are millions of diabetics in America. Under
normal circumstances, they manage 
their condition well through diet and exercise, and
carry insulin for managing blood-sugar 
levels. During an unexpected disaster, a diabetic’s
blood sugar may be affected, causing 
it to fluctuate out of range of the manageable
parameters. Access to insulin and/or food 
may be interrupted when it is needed most and insulin
shock or diabetic coma may ensue.
Diabetic coma is caused when the victim takes
insufficient insulin and/or overeats. It 


--- Page 157 ---
can also be caused by injury, infection, or stress.
If not recognized and treated promptly, 
brain damage can occur. The signs and symptoms are:
•       
Rapid and deep breathing
•       
Dehydration indicated by dry, warm skin and sunken
eyes
•       
A rapid and weak pulse
•       
Low blood pressure
•       
Impaired consciousness or coma
Insulin shock occurs when too much insulin or too
little food results in insufficient sugar 
to feed the brain. This condition develops slowly,
but must be reversed to prevent brain 
damage. The sign and symptoms of insulin shock are:
•       
Unusual behavior or combativeness
•       
Sweating
•       
Pale moist skin
•       
Dizziness and headache
•       
Rapid respirations
•       
Hunger
•       
Late-stage seizures and coma
--- Page 140 ---
124  James C. Jones
Ask anyone exhibiting these symptoms, “Are you a
diabetic?” If they answer yes, then ask 
“Have you taken your insulin today? Also ask, “Have


--- Page 158 ---
you eaten today?” Those answers 
should give a good indication of the problem.
If the victim has not taken their insulin or has
overeaten recently, they are probably 
suffering from a diabetic coma and they can be
prompted to take insulin if available.
•       
If the victim has taken their insulin, but not eaten
enough recently, the 
administration of sweetened beverages or sublingual
glucose usually restores 
normalcy.
•       
Diagnosis of diabetic coma versus an insulin shock
can be difficult, especially 
in the unconscious patient. If in doubt, providing
sweetened drinks if 
conscious or sublingual sugar or glucose paste if
unconscious can do no harm.
Airway Obstructions
While airway obstruction is not necessarily
associated with disaster situations, they are 
a common cause of unnecessary death, and therefore,
knowing how to clear an airway 
obstruction must be included in a survivalist’s skill
set.
Obstructed Airway/Respiratory Arrest
Urgency
The first act in determining priorities during mass-
casualty situations is opening the 
airway and discerning whether or not the victim is
breathing. The longer that the 
patient has not been breathing, the less likely they
are to recover. Within five minutes of 
respiratory arrest, the heart will stop circulating
blood and the brain will begin to suffer 
irreversible damages. In most cases respiratory
arrest is the result of airway obstructions 
that can be corrected by use of the airway-clearing
maneuver or simply repositioning the 


--- Page 159 ---
head. The tongue may also create an obstruction in an
unconscious patient.
Recognition:
•       
If a person is conscious with airway obstruction,
then he or she will be unable 
to speak or cough forcefully. They may give the
universal sign of choking by 
placing a hand at their throat. There is no excuse
for a person to die from this.
•       
A person may be unconscious or semiconscious if he or
she displays pale or 
blue skin coloration. He or she may also be
unresponsive or gasping and 
wheezing.
--- Page 141 ---
150 Survival Secrets  125
Action:
If you observe the patient choking before loss of
consciousness, initiate the airway-
clearing maneuver as shown below.
Administering the airway-clearing maneuver to a
conscious or 
semiconscious victim.
Hands clasped just below the rib cage, pull
forcefully in and up. Keep at it until either 
the obstruction is expelled or the patient loses
consciousness. You should be braced to 
lower the patient down gently if this happens. Send
for help and start CPR.
 If you find an apparently unconscious patient, shake
their shoulders and shout “Are 
you okay?” to awaken them. An unresponsive patient is
a medical emergency. Call 911 
or have someone do so immediately before initiating
any further action. Tilt the head 
and lift the jaw to open the airway. Look at the


--- Page 160 ---
chest, listen for breathing, and feel air 
on your cheek to determine if the person is
breathing. Modern protocols eliminate the 
steps of abdominal thrusts for airway clearing, pulse
check, and rescue breathing. If the 
patient is not breathing with the head tilted as
shown in the figure above, then initiate 
CPR immediately.

72  �What kinds of survival and 
emergency supplies should I keep 
in my vehicle(s)?
Getting stranded in a storm, or finding that a
disaster will prevent you from reaching 
your home or other emergency supply sources for some
time, could put you and those 
with you in serious danger. Some of the items listed
will allow you to restart your vehicle 
or get it unstuck in snow or mud, while the other
items are essential to surviving a few 
days trapped in a storm or other situation. It is
usually not advisable to leave your vehicle 
when stuck in snow and cold weather. You can run the
engine periodically to warm the 
interior. Be sure the exhaust pipe is clear to
prevent being overcome by carbon monoxide.
  1.     Jumper cables or a charged battery booster
  2.     Fix-a-Flat
  3.     A small fire extinguisher
  4.     Road flares and/or reflectors
  5.     A small folding shovel
  6.     A blanket

73  �What are some methods I can use 
to recognize and avoid accidents, 
injuries, and personal disasters?
Modern industrial safety techniques can easily be
applied to your personal life to reduce 
the chances of you and your family becoming victims
of your own unsafe actions. The 
fact that over 80 percent of accidents happen to just
20 percent of the population clearly 
indicates that some people are better at controlling
their risks than others. Serious injuries, 
illnesses, financial losses, or a home fire are
devastating and greatly reduce your ability to 
prepare for or to survive a general disaster. The
following are proven techniques used to 
recognize and prevent damage and injury. They can be
used by the survivalist to improve 
home safety and emergency preparedness as well.
Hazard Recognition
It is very easy to overlook hazardous conditions and
unsafe habits as we go about our 
daily lives. Our parents may have warned us not to
seek out trouble, and it is human 
nature to focus in what we are doing at the current
moment. We may not recognize a 
hazard because we cannot actually see it or because


--- Page 162 ---
we lack the technical information 
needed, but the great majority of hazards and unsafe
habits are recognizable to anyone 
with common sense, yet we put off fixing the problem
or changing the behavior.
Near-Miss Incidents
In theory, there are three hundred near misses and
about thirty small injuries before a 
serious injury or death occurs from any hazard or
unsafe habit. Every near miss incident 
is a warning and an opportunity to fix the problem or
change the habit before it gets you. 
For example: You almost tripped on that loose carpet
on the stairs, or you almost fell of 
that old rickety ladder. Do you keep going and forget
the event, or do you make sure 
to put correcting these hazards on the top of your
to-do list? Never ignore a near-miss 
incident or something that looks wrong. These are
gifts of warning. This also applies to 
preparedness. Did you almost lose your job? Did an
assault or home invasion occur in 
your community? Did your coworkers get laid off?
These are near-misses you need to act 
on to avoid or survive.
Unsafe Acts vs. Unsafe Conditions
Unsafe conditions such as broken steps or worn
electrical cords are dangerous and must 
be corrected, as the majority (90 percent) of all
injuries are the result of unsafe acts of 
--- Page 144 ---
128  James C. Jones
people. A spill on the kitchen floor that is not
cleaned up is not an unsafe condition; 
it is the act of whoever spilled it and did not clean
it up. The batteries taken out of the 
smoke detector was an act. Letting combustibles pile
up near the furnace is an act. Unsafe 


--- Page 163 ---
driving is an act. Examine your habits, and the
habits of your loved ones, for potential 
risk-taking.
Unsafe Habits
One of the most common sentences I hear from accident
victims is “I’ve been doing it 
that way for years.” We develop habits based on the
immediate rewards we get for our 
acts. If we complete an action and get any kind of
small and immediate reward from 
it, then we tend to continue doing it. The reward can
be saving a few seconds, using 
less energy, or saving a few dollars. The immediate
reward has much more impact than 
any potential long-term dangers. For example,
cigarettes provide an immediate reward 
(good feeling) and become a habit in spite of the
horrible long-term risks. The driver 
who rolls through a stop sign at deserted
intersections and is rewarded by getting to 
work early will keep doing it until they are hit or
hit someone. Safety glasses and gloves 
are uncomfortable; reading the labels on insecticides
takes time. Fire extinguishers cost 
money you could spend on more immediately enjoyable
items. This type of thinking is 
human nature but can have tragic consequences if not
managed. Therefore, it’s important 
to get in the habit of thinking about the long-term
results of your habits and correct those 
that are dangerous to your health and safety
What If Analysis
Most accidents happen when several unsafe conditions
and unsafe habits come together. 
For example, if you are in the habit of wearing flip-
flops on the stairs and you never fixed 
that worn carpeting there, or you are in the habit of
walking to your car without looking 
around and today there is a mugger in the parking
lot. It is prudent and proactive to 


--- Page 164 ---
examine your daily actions and your environment
(home, work, road, etc.) and ask “what 
if?” What if there is a carjacker at the corner? What
if a train is coming? What if this gas can 
leaks? What if my hand slips? This is called a
questioning attitude and it can save your life.
Management of Change
Even in a fairly safe environment, changes can result
in disaster. In fact, many of history’s 
greatest disasters were caused by unmanaged changes
meeting unsafe acts or conditions. 
For example, you may be in the habit of backing out
of your driveway without looking, 
but the school schedule has changed today and there
are children running for the bus; 
needless to say, this could end terribly. If you are
correcting unsafe acts and conditions, 
you are much safer, but watch out for changes. Any
kind of change in weather, schedules, 
routes, people, the building, hobbies, or the like
can bring new hazards. What was safe 
before may now have risk. Think and analyze.
--- Page 145 ---
150 Survival Secrets  129
Safety Inspections
You seldom see what you are not looking for. You may
find it quite amazing what kinds 
of hazards you find at home once you begin a focused
safety inspection. Remember 
that if a hazard exists, it will result in a problem
sooner or later. Safety-related repairs 
and improvements should always take priority over
convenience, budget, and aesthetic 
considerations.
Root Causes Determination
When you recognize a hazard, even if no injury
occurred, ask why it is present. Just fixing 
the immediate hazard may not be enough. There is


--- Page 165 ---
probably a deeper cause for the unsafe 
condition or unsafe act that should be addressed. For
example, if you find your child 
playing with drain cleaner, you get it away from him
in time and place it on a high shelf. 
That takes care of the immediate danger, but why was
the drain cleaner available in the 
first place? The answer may be that you keep lots of
chemicals under the sink. But why 
are chemicals under the sink, at a child’s eye level?
It’s clear that you must search your 
home and find all kinds of poisons, sharp objects,
choking hazards, matches, and on so. 
that need to be locked up or removed. This can lead
you to the root cause of many kinds 
of problems and provide an opportunity for real
improvements.
Remember that most accidents are caused by unsafe
acts that you control. Having 
recognized your unsafe habits, make a list of dos and
don’ts. Some key dos and don’ts: 
don’t leave doors unlocked; do turn on the lights
before going in; don’t stand on chairs; 
do remove fuses and check for current flow before
working on electrical wires; and don’t 
leave loaded firearms out.

74  �What are some common items that 
I can use as improvised survival 
implements?
•       
Aluminum foil can be folded or formed into containers
to cook food or boil 
water.
•       
Clear plastic bottles can be used to hold water and
allow solar UV rays to 


--- Page 166 ---
purify it.
•       
Large plastic trash bags can be fashioned into a
rainsuit or protective clothing. 
They can used be used to gather water.
•       
Plastic tarps and sheets can be used for shelter or
ponchos.
•       
Napkins can be used as a temporary dust mask or
bandage or to filter water.
•       
Any kind of cloth can be used as dust mask, bandage,
or tourniquet.
•       
A fire extinguisher can be a weapon.
•       
Saran Wrap can be used as a bandage or eye
protection, or to secure a splint.
•       
Newspaper makes excellent insulation, fire starter,
or splinting material.
•       
A pen or a spray can could be used as a defensive
weapon.
These are just a few examples. Nature provides
branches, rocks, sand, mud, and other 
survival items. Towns and cities are filled with
metal, wire, cordage, cardboard, plastic, 
and other materials that could be used in an
emergency. All of these materials can be used 
to create survival tools.
--- Page 147 ---
131
75  �What are the most common 
outdoor, cold-weather-related 
emergencies?
Outdoor conditions can quickly become hazardous for


--- Page 167 ---
the unprepared during the 
colder months. Temperatures and winds can change
quickly in autumn and spring. The 
temperatures in high altitudes can drop drastically
even during summer months. The two 
most common serious medical problems caused by cold
temperatures are hypothermia 
and frostbite. Both can develop into life-threatening
and debilitating conditions quickly 
if not recognized and treated promptly.
Hypothermia (exposure)
Hypothermia is a serious and life-threatening
condition. Being inadequately dressed for 
the cold, or allowing your clothing to get wet from
rain, mist, or sweating, can lead to 
hypothermia, even in temperatures as high as sixty
degrees. Physical exhaustion caused 
by running or survival-related work can increase the
danger of hypothermia. This is 
why energy conservation and staying dry are the first
priority in outdoor survival. Many 
people have died of exposure when caught unprepared
for a weather change. You may 
go out for a few hours on a warm autumn day and be
caught in a rainstorm that drops 
the temperatures to the forties in minutes. As a rule
of thumb, always dress for what 
the weather could be, not for what it is. Always
carry survival items that include a rain 
poncho, dry socks, and a warm cap. Since the
survivalist may need to evacuate or operate 
during cold and/or wet weather, the recognition and
treatment of hypothermia can be a 
critical skill.
The first warning of impending hypothermia is intense
and uncontrollable shivering, 
a sign of the body’s last-ditch attempt to get warm.
Once shivering stops, the victim 
becomes sleepy and listless with slurred speech and a
stumbling gait. If swift intervention 


--- Page 168 ---
is not initiated, then unconsciousness and death will
follow. It must be understood that 
a person who has ceased shivering and begun to show
advanced signs of hypothermia 
may continue to decline and die, even after being
brought into a warm environment, 
because their internal heat production has shut down.
Prevention and early treatment 
are essential. Treatment of hypothermia includes the
removal of cold, wet clothing and 
the administration of warm sweetened liquids while
the victim is still conscious. Warm 
clothes or heat packs can be placed on the sides of
the neck, armpits, and groin.
Avoid rubbing or rapid warming of extremities, which
may cause cold blood to rush 
to the heart, thus inducing fibrillation. Gentle
external warming and warm liquids are 
key. An unconscious or semiconscious victim can be
placed into a sleeping bag unclothed 
--- Page 148 ---
132  James C. Jones
with other persons. Hypothermia is a medical
emergency! Get the victim to a hospital as 
fast as possible.
Frostbite
Frostbite can be a disabling and possibly fatal
condition. Once your hands or feet become 
frozen, you will be unable to perform most other
survival-related tasks, and so your 
survival chances are dramatically reduced. Thick
gloves and socks should be worn in cold 
weather, but these may become lost or wet in a
survival situation. Keeping two extra pairs 
of warm socks under your shirt or in your survival
kit is highly recommended. Socks can 
be used as a foot covering, or as mittens when
needed. Frostbite usually affects the fingers, 


--- Page 169 ---
toes, nose, and ears first. If nothing is done, the
circulation to these extremities is reduced 
and frostbite ensues. The skin becomes pale, white,
and numb to the touch. Continuing 
exposure results in stiff, leathery, and hard skin as
blood circulation is completely stopped. 
Never rub frostbitten tissue, as this will cause
further damage. Thaw the extremity in 
warm water not exceeding 105 degrees Fahrenheit. The
tissues will become red, painful, 
and swollen. Wrap the thawed extremities in soft
bandages. If tissues do not recover 
sensation, remain numb, and turn black, then the
tissue is dead and infection will follow. 
Prompt medical attention and antibiotics are
essential for these cases.
--- Page 149 ---
133
76  �What are the most common 
outdoor, hot-weather-related 
emergencies?
A survival situation may involve great physical
exertions in hot-weather conditions. 
Additionally, prolonged or indefinite power outages
and water shortages could occur as a 
result of a variety of disasters. Many folks today
have become accustomed to air-conditioning 
and access to fans and cold drinks, and so are highly
susceptible to heat exhaustion and 
heatstroke. Children and the elderly are especially
susceptible to heat related problems, 
and should be observed for the first signs of an
issue. These conditions are much better 
avoided by limiting strenuous activities and exposure
to the sun and maintaining a high 
level of hydration. A prolonged lack of the need to
urinate or issuing dark yellow urine 
indicates inadequate hydration. Don’t wait for these


--- Page 170 ---
signs to start drinking plenty of water. 
Because prolonged sweating will deplete the body of
salt and other electrolytes needed for 
muscles, including the heart, sports drinks are
preferable to water. Therefore, you may want 
to consider including powdered sports drink in your
survival packs as well. Heat exhaustion 
and heatstroke are the most common emergencies
related to hot conditions.
Heat Exhaustion
Heat exhaustion may be regarded as a precursor to
heatstroke. The victim will feel weak 
and dizzy with pale, cool skin and profuse sweating
as the body struggles to maintain a safe 
temperature. Get the victim to a cool, shaded
location as fast as possible. If practical, have the 
victim lie down with feet elevated twelve to eighteen
inches as you would for shock. Provide 
cool, but not cold, drinks. If available, provide
electrolyte-enhanced “sports drinks.” Keep 
the victim at rest. Consider calling 911 for children
and elderly or chronically ill victims.
Heatstroke
Heatstroke occurs when the body’s cooling system has
failed. The victim is weak, dizzy, 
and will have a headache. The most recognizable
symptom will be that there is no 
sweating and the victim will feel hot and dry to the
touch. If the victim is not cooled 
rapidly, then organ damage, brain damage, and death
will occur. If EMS is available, call 
911 immediately. Cool the victim rapidly by any means
available. Place cold packs under 
the armpits and at the neck and groin to cool the
blood. If possible, place the victim in a 
cold bath or cold shower. Maintain efforts until the
victim revives.
Those accustomed to hot and humid conditions should
be especially cautious in dry, 
desert-like heat. Evaporation of moisture from the


--- Page 171 ---
skin is rapid and the comfort can be 
misleading. Dehydration can occur before you feel
thirsty, so drink water frequently.
--- Page 150 ---
134
77  �How can I defend my home in 
a rural area under survival and 
disaster conditions?
In survival manuals, much attention is given to home
defense and survival for urban and 
suburban areas. But the rural homestead or farm is
not immune to raiding and looting by 
criminal groups and desperate refugees during a truly
massive and extended catastrophe. 
Constant alertness, preparation, and proactive
intervention are key elements.
Alertness
•       
Once it is evident that law and order have broken
down and the possibility of assault 
is evident, the survivalist must establish an around-
the-clock watch schedule.
•       
Long continuous watch shifts are difficult to
sustain, and alertness tends to 
dwindle after three to four hours. Try to set up
watch schedules with no more 
than four hours on and at least twelve hours off.
This can be maintained 
indefinitely without overly fatiguing anyone.
•       
If at all possible, have two people on each watch to
ensure that no one falls 
asleep. That makes for a total of eight able-bodied
lookouts.
•       
If you do not have enough people for an effective
around-the-clock watch, you 


--- Page 172 ---
should hide away from obvious targets such as cabins
or tents so that you are 
not trapped or surrounded.
•       
Consider having one member pack up and sleep in
hiding about fifty to one 
hundred yards away from the main camp, at a location
where he or she can 
alert or rescue the others from intruders.
•       
Night-vision equipment is an excellent investment for
rural defense at night. 
Acquiring this gear should be a high priority.
•       
The sentry’s duty is to give warning of the presence
of a threat and its nature, 
direction, and distance as soon as possible. It is
preferable that a radio or other 
silent method is used to alert the group of the
threat so that the intruder is not 
aware of being detected.
•       
Dogs and alarm devices can greatly enhance warning
capability.
Defensive Preparations
•       
Intruders will probably come from roads and trails
from the direction of high-
population areas, so be especially observant of these
routes and directions.
--- Page 151 ---
150 Survival Secrets  135
•       
Remove mailboxes and signs from roads that may
attract intruders.
•       
If possible, camouflage access roads and driveways
with branches and debris.


--- Page 173 ---
•       
Preestablish well-camouflaged defensive positions
with trenches, sandbags, and 
logs.
•       
Rural defense requires the possession of effective,
long-range rifles with high-
capacity magazines and a large supply of ammunition.
•       
Maintain fencing around the close defense perimeter,
but do not depend on it 
alone.
•       
During times of danger, keep vehicles out of sight
from the road, and keep 
lights off or blanket windows at night so as not to
attract attention.
•       
Plan for various scenarios including single
assailants, group assaults, and 
nonaggressive refugees, and know how to withdraw and
evacuate as a last 
resort.
•       
Of course, your basic survival preparations should
already have stocked enough 
water, food, and other supplies for a prolonged stay
at home.
•       
One of the most effective preparations you can make
is to establish a mutual 
defense arrangement with neighbors in advance. Such
cooperation would 
confer a huge survival advantage against aggressive
looters and gangs in a 
prolonged catastrophe.
Proactive Intervention
•       
The group must have preplanned actions for each
intrusion situation.


--- Page 174 ---
•       
If it appears that the intruders intend to just pass
by without approaching your 
location, let them do so without exposing your
defenses and numbers, but be 
aware that they may double back or circle around to
assault from a different 
direction or after dark.
•       
If the approaching group does not appear aggressive,
they should be challenged 
from a concealed and protected location. They should
be told to go on their 
way and that you are armed and will not permit harm
to yourself or your 
family. Do not expose your entire group or weapons.
An unknown force is 
much more likely to discourage aggression and is much
better able to fight if 
necessary.
•       
Warning shots and threats show weakness, may initiate
an unnecessary battle, 
and may even attract more trouble.
•       
If the intruders are armed and deploy for an obvious
assault, you are justified 
in executing an ambush before they can besiege your
home or camp. A 
preemptive surprise may be your only chance against a
superior number.
--- Page 152 ---
136
78  �What kinds of food should a 
survivalist store at home for long-
term emergencies and how much 
food should they store?
The average home usually has five to ten days’ worth


--- Page 175 ---
of extra groceries that can be used 
up before you start using your emergency food
supplies. Most disasters will resolve within 
thirty days, or will degenerate into a situation that
requires you to either evacuate or 
prepare for a long siege. If evacuation is more
likely, then your thirty-day home stock 
should be adequate and your focus must be on
dehydrated foods in a true, full-sized 
survival pack. If you think that staying home
(shelter in place) is more likely, then start 
working toward a larger supply of food.
Dehydrated survival foods are useful, but assume that
the survivor will have unlimited 
water available. If storage space is an issue,
dehydrated foods are a good choice; however 
you must then store enough water, fuel, and
alternative cooking stoves to reconstitute 
them. If you have enough room to store nonperishable
dry and canned foods, this is a 
more effective and economical choice. A good
compromise would be to start by building 
up thirty to sixty days’ worth of normal,
nonperishable groceries and then work on 
getting another ten months’ worth of dehydrated
foods. Try to rotate them regularly 
and replace and use these within a year or two of
their expiration. While we can afford 
to be concerned about additives, salt, sugar, and fat
content when food is plentiful, these 
concerns are insignificant in a disaster situation.
The most common method of assuring that you have food
when you need it is stocking 
up and storing it. In the short term, it is faster,
cheaper, and takes less work than other 
methods. For home survival where weight and space are
not a big issue, the best method 
is too simply stock up on various canned goods and
other staples (e.g., sugar, honey, 
flower, rice, etc.), rotating them into use. Most of


--- Page 176 ---
these items last at least a few years. 
Several preparedness supply companies actually
provide foods and storage racks for such 
systems. Where space is limited or where weight is an
issue, dehydrated foods are more 
practical. These are more expensive, but keep much
longer and you can carry a lot more 
food if you need to evacuate. You do need to have a
lot of safe water and fuel for heating 
it to reconstitute these products.
While it is a well-established theory that you can
survive three weeks without food, 
this assumes that you start out well fed, in good
health, in a warm environment, and are 
at rest most of the time. After five to ten days
without nourishment, weakness and mental 
deterioration will impede survival capabilities. It
is much better to stretch your rations 
and eat daily than to depend on going without food
for several days.
--- Page 153 ---
150 Survival Secrets  137
Two thousand calories per day is the general
recommendation for maintaining health. 
Fifty grams of protein and three hundred grams of
carbohydrates are also recommended. 
These daily requirements are listed on all food
packaging, along with the nutritional 
contents of the product per serving. You can easily
calculate how much of each product 
you need to supply the daily requirements per person
for a given number of days. While 
avoiding fat, calories, sugar, and salt may be
prudent dietary choices during normal 
times, these priorities must be set aside in survival
situations. Any food is better than no 
food. The body’s requirements for calories is much
higher under the stressful situations 


--- Page 177 ---
that would exist in an emergency. Cold conditions
also require higher caloric intake. So 
the established “minimum daily requirement” may not
meet your needs. Try to err on the 
high side for stored food and water.
In addition to canned goods, dehydrated, and freeze-
dried survival foods, there are 
actually many “off the shelf” grocery store items
that are inexpensive, nonperishable, and 
highly nutritious. The ones shown below are averages
of several sources, but in all cases 
the use of vacuum packaging and dry storage will
prolong shelf life.
•       
Pasta: Pasta is high in carbohydrates and easy to use
in lots of dishes. Pasta has 
a shelf life of at least fifteen years. Minimum per
person is twenty-five pounds.
•       
Rice: Rice is high in carbohydrates and useful in
many dishes. Store only 
whole-grain rice, as instant rice will not keep well.
Minimum per person is 
twenty-five pounds.
•       
Beans: Pinto beans, black beans, garbanzo beans, red
beans, lintels and other 
types can be stored for twenty to thirty years, are
easy to cook, and are a good 
source of protein. Minimum per person stored is
thirty pounds.
•       
Grits: Grits are made from the cornmeal process and
are a good source of 
nutrition. They can be used as cereal, fried, or as a
base in many recipes. You 
can use them to replace part or all of the
recommended grain storage.
•       
Nuts: These are usually vacuum packed and store for


--- Page 178 ---
decades. They are a 
great source of protein and other nutrients. Minimum
per person stored is ten 
pounds.
•       
Peanut Butter: A forty-ounce jar of peanut butter
contains 6,650 calories. 
That’s more than a three day food supply. It only has
a shelf life of about three 
to four years, so you need to rotate it. Minimum per
person is three jars.
•       
Whole grains: Whole grains are often sold as survival
foods. They do provide 
good nutrition, but to make baked goods (e.g., bread,
etc.), you need a grain 
mill to grind them into flour. Whole grains keep much
longer than flour. Oats 
can simply be made into oatmeal or in baking. Minimum
per person stored is 
twenty-five pounds.
•       
Dried Fruits: Dried fruits such as dates, raisins,
apple slices, banana slices, 
figs, and apricots can be stored for many years and
provide important vitamins 
to the diet. Minimum per person is ten pounds.
--- Page 154 ---
138  James C. Jones
•       
Beef and Turkey Jerky: Jerky or dehydrated meats are
an important source of 
calories and protein to your diet. If you make jerky
yourself, be sure to salt it 
and remove all the fat before drying. Vacuum-packed
jerky should keep for at 
least two years and can be reconstituted in soups or
stews, or eaten as is.


--- Page 179 ---
•       
Powdered Milk: Powdered milk is a good source of
vitamins and other 
nutrients. Store-bought products should be
immediately vacuum packed 
for the best shelf life, but the vitamins degrade
over time. Powdered milk 
specifically packaged in cans for storage will last
up to fifteen years, but should 
be repackaged in airtight containers once opened.
Minimum per person is five 
pounds.
•       
Powdered Eggs: Powered eggs are nutritious, have a
shelf life of about ten 
years if kept in airtight or vacuum-packed
containers. They can be used as 
scrambled eggs or in a variety of recipes. Minimum
per person is five pounds.
•       
Canned Vegetables: Canned vegetables such as spinach,
corn, green beans, 
and carrots are essential to health and keep for four
years or longer. Vegetables 
can be stored for many years, but canned fruits
should be rotated every few 
years as the acid can eat through the cans over time.
Minimum per person is 
fifteen to twenty cans.
•       
Canned Meats: Canned meats such as SPAM, corned beef,
or Vienna sausage 
are very nutritious and store well. You can also
stock up on canned tuna and 
chicken for variety. The recommended shelf life is
two to four years, but I have 
used products that were as much as fifteen years old.
Canned anchovies and 
sardines in oil keep indefinitely. Minimum per person
twelve cans.


--- Page 180 ---
•       
Bouillon and Soup Mixes: Bouillon cubes and soup mix
envelopes take up 
very little space and provide a way to create tasty
soups from what you have 
stored and what you may be able to gather. Carrying
these in your survival 
pack can make otherwise unappealing foraged foods
more palatable.
•       
Honey: Honey is sometimes called the perfect food.
Honey keeps indefinitely 
and can be substituted for sugar in many uses.
Minimum per person stored is 
two to three pounds.
•       
Sugar: Sugar is a nonperishable staple if kept in
airtight, dry containers. It can 
be used in all kinds of recipes. I recommend keeping
both white and brown 
sugar. Minimum per person stored is five pounds.
•       
Flour: Useful in all kinds of cooking and baking. Can
last up to 10 years if 
sealed and dry. Minimum per person is fifty pounds.
•       
Coffee and Tea: Depending on your tastes, these
beverages offer comfort, 
warmth, and stimulation under any condition. These
will be high-value trade 
goods during a long-term disaster. Minimum per person
stored is ten pounds 
or four hundred tea bags.

•       
Vinegar: Vinegar has many uses in cooking and food
preservation. Apple cider 


--- Page 181 ---
vinegar is even useful in alternative medicine. You
definitely want to have a 
few gallons.
•       
Cooking Oils and Shortening: A necessary ingredient
in baking and frying. 
Minimum per person is one gallon.
•       
Salt: Used to enhance flavors and for a preservative.
It will be in demand 
during a prolonged emergency. Minimum per person
stored is five pounds.
•       
Spices: A good selection of spices can make otherwise
bland “survival food” 
more enjoyable. The selection depends on your taste.
Other Stuff: There are lots of other options and
additions. You can add freeze-dried 
meals to reduce storage space, spaghetti sauce to
enhance the pastas, molasses in place of 
some honey, Bisquick (shelf life of two to three
years) baking mix in place of flour. You 
may want to add a few bags of hard candy for comfort
and quick energy. Hard candy 
lasts a long time if kept dry and cool. Maybe some
cans of baked beans or some of your 
own canned foods.
A number of options for food stocking. Left to right:
(1) homemade food stock 
consisting of pasta, rice, beans, oatmeal, and other
storable foods in vacuum packed 
bags; (2) stack of three ready-made, thirty-day
containers of freeze-dried meals; (3) box 
of six #10 cans of survival foods from a preparedness
supply outlet; (4) tote bins full of 
freeze-dried foods, MREs, and canned goods.

79  �What kinds of survival camps 
would be used by survivalists 
during evacuations and long-term 
encampments?
Under most emergency situations, it is best to remain
in the shelter provided by your 
home and use the supplies and equipment there. Once
you have elected to take to the 
road, you are placing yourself and your family at the
mercy of the environment and 
a variety of hazards with the limited supplies you
can carry. Unless you have a well-
established route to a well-supplied retreat, you
should regard taking a hike as the last 
resort. There are several scenarios that would
justify or even necessitate evacuation and 
relocation under emergency conditions. Your home
could be in imminent danger of 
destruction from floods, fires, or looters. You may
run out of supplies. Roving gangs or 
spreading epidemics could make the area unsafe. Some
kind of “police state” action could 
make moving to the hills preferable to remaining in
towns.
So let’s look at the various types of camps or
bivouacs that one might establish. There 
are three basic kinds of camps that can be
established. There is the “hasty camp” that 
you put up nightly while on the move or when weather
forces you to halt. There is the 
“survival camp” that an individual or family
establishes where they intend to stay for 
a while to seek shelter, rest, and gather food. There
is the base camp where a group of 
families or an organization sets up a long-term base
to provide all life-sustaining supplies 
and services for an indefinites time. Each of these
camps requires shelter, water, food, 
warmth, sanitation, and security. In many cases
camouflage and concealment will be 


--- Page 183 ---
beneficial to survival.
The Hasty Camp
The hasty camp can take many forms, depending on the
weather, location, and external 
hazards. Since such camps are inevitably established
in close proximity to routes where 
desperate people may be moving, concealment and
security must take a high priority. 
The immediate availability of water is not necessary
since you should have been gathering 
water while on the move. Select an area well away
from your trail or any other trails or 
roads. If there is any possibility of a hostile
population, you should have a dark cold camp 
with no fire and no candles or lanterns. Use small
mini-lights or red-lens flashlights if 
you must, but try to have everything set up before
dark. If you must use a fire to cook or 
boil water, do so before dark and minimize smoke. You
should locate a site well before 
dark and scout the surrounding area to be sure that
you are truly in a safe spot; this is 
usually a thicket or natural concealed location.
Abandoned buildings or natural shelters 
--- Page 157 ---
150 Survival Secrets  141
can be used only if they are well off the main 
roads. Remember, if you think it’s a good place to 
go, so will others.
Regardless of how well selected your camp is, 
you must put security first. Unfortunately there 
is not much time to fortify a hasty camp. Be sure 
you establish your escape routes before dark. 
Use brittle twigs and branches to put up natural 
looking barriers that will make approaches 
difficult and noisy.
Have your weapon(s) immediately at hand. 
You should have all of your supplies not used for 


--- Page 184 ---
shelter packed to go. If you have to run, know 
where you are going next and have your weapon and
most of your supplies with you. 
You should never have any survival supplies you are
not immediately using outside 
of your pack. Of course if you are not alone, take
turns on watch through the night. 
Minimize your impact on the camp area and 
cover up or carry out any waste or trash. Signs 
of a well-supplied camp could make others want 
to follow your trail. In a hasty camp, you have 
your water and food from your pack to use. You 
may be lucky enough to find some edible plants or 
catch fish or small game, but neither is a priority. 
The hasty camp is about shelter, warmth, security, 
and preparing food that you have. While you still 
need to bury human waste, sanitation is not a 
serious problem in a short stay.
Note: The above assumes that hostile conditions 
exist. Under such conditions, any campfire and 
smoke can be seen for miles and will attract 
serious trouble. Of course if rescue is needed and/
or concealment is not necessary, a campfire may 
be desirable. Extreme cold may justify the risk of 
a small fire if it is in a pit or well surrounded by
logs. Remember that the fire will light 
up overhead trees and branches like a sign
advertising your location.
The Survival Camp
The survival camp is much harder to create than the
hasty camp. While it starts out 
based on what you have brought with you, its success
depends on a good location, as well 
as available water, food, and building supplies.
Unless there are pre-positioned caches 
A hasty abyss of deadfall and branches can 
slow down intruders and make approaches 
noisy.
With more time sharpened branches can 
be placed to prevent infiltration or rushing 


--- Page 185 ---
attacks on your camp 
--- Page 158 ---
142  James C. Jones
of food, tools, and other supplies, it will require
hunting, foraging, quick thinking, and 
building skills. You need to spend more time on
selection of a site. You may need to try 
several hasty camps before you are sure that a
location is safe for this more permanent 
campsite. In this case you need to have access to
water and be able to hunt, trap, fish, and 
forage for food in the area. You may also need to
forage in nearby towns and abandoned 
buildings for materials such as wire, plastic, cloth,
rope, containers, metal, and other 
materials. Depending on the situation you may or may
not want to interact with other 
survivors or occupants in the area. Remember that
these folks may be desperate and may 
not welcome your foraging and hunting in the same
area. Of course, there are many who 
may be openly hostile. Your camp should be located
well back from any trails, roads, 
or occupied areas. In this case you probably will
need to have fires, and some noise and 
odors will be unavoidable. But keep fires and smoke
to a minimum and do not wear trails 
to and from your camp. Worn trails, trash, and other
signs of foraging will all attract 
attention. These are particularly troublesome in fall
and winter when there is less foliage 
and tracks in the snow are very hard to conceal. The
gathering of firewood and building 
materials will soon clear the area of deadwood and
branches, giving more evidence of 
your camp. After a few weeks your impact on the area
will be hard to conceal. Two 
solutions to these hazards are:


--- Page 186 ---
•       
Move your camp every few weeks. Doing this gives you
fresh foraging and 
hunting territory while reducing your risk of being
raided by hostile groups. 
You should search out and designate your next
campsite as soon as you settle in 
the current one. You may even want to cache some
supplies there and make it 
your emergency evacuation assembly point.
•       
If constant moving of the camp is impractical, you
can minimize your 
foraging, hunting, and other activities within a few
miles of the camp and go 
out on foraging and hunting expeditions to remote
areas well away from your 
camp.
Another feature of the survival camp is that it
justifies the time and effort to establish basic 
fortification. You should be able to set up and man a
lookout post that will spot intruders 
well before they can detect the camp. You can use
deadwood, branches, ditches, and other 
material to slow down any form of intrusion long
enough to be identified and resisted or 
for you to evacuate. You should consider having
trenches or other bullet-resistant cover 
available for all camp members. Finally, you must
have a plan for evacuation and a plan 
for camp defense established and practiced.
Sanitation is another issue that becomes critical in
a long-term camp. Human waste, 
cooking waste, and the offal from cleaning fish and
game will attract unwanted insects, 
animals, and disease that will soon render the camp
untenable. These wastes must be 
buried well away from the occupied camp and water
supplies. Clear procedures must 
be in place as soon as camp is established. Since


--- Page 187 ---
waste disposal and personal hygiene 
--- Page 159 ---
150 Survival Secrets  143
issues will probably be addressed outside of the
camp’s main defensive perimeter, it will 
be necessary to have an armed guard accompany anyone
visiting these facilities. It is a 
standard procedure for a hostile intruder to take
down a person who is outside the camp 
and then infiltrate in their clothing as if
returning.

80  �What are the prospects for 
survival for the current and next 
generations?
Many believe that the social, political, and
technological developments of the twentieth 
century shifted societal values from favoring freedom
and self-reliance to favoring a 
culture of compliance and dependency. Urbanization
and centralization have created a 
life-support system that is unstable and fragile.
Survivalists and preppers are generally 
unpopular because they tend to remind people of their
own vulnerability. Simply put, 
our current level of population and civilization is
unsustainable. This truth has been 
recognized by many brilliant thinkers, but denial of
this truth is a much stronger political 
and economic force. The necessary actions to avoid
economic collapse, the spread of 
an epidemic, famines and other catastrophes are often
too unpopular and painful to 
be implemented. How and when a worldwide catastrophe
will occur is impossible to 


--- Page 188 ---
predict, but it will happen soon enough. In fact
these things are already occurring as 
increasing natural disasters, political chaos,
terrorism, economic decline, and escalating 
worldwide tensions. Most persons recognize that
things are deteriorating, and that the 
future will likely not be as good as the past.
Obsessive entertainment and the addictive 
use of technology are really opiates to avoid reality
and responsibility. The values and 
skills of self-reliance and personal responsibility
have been virtually extinguished over 
the past fifty years. So we have a mainly helpless
and dependent population moving into 
what may be the most dangerous and challenging times
in human history.
Twenty-first-century technology has misled the
younger generations into blindly 
accepting false security while sacrificing their real
freedoms and privacy. Human nature 
is more disposed to avoid recognition of the matrix
of dangers and disasters people will 
experience in the next several decades. Interest in
preparedness and self-reliance will grow 
as reality becomes harder to ignore, but most people
will remain in denial until becoming 
victims of catastrophe. They may survive in a
devastated and repressive society, or perish 
from violence, resource shortages, or diseases.
Survivalists have a moral obligation to attempt to
spread survival knowledge and 
capability to as many members of the younger
generations as possible. The foundation of 
such efforts should be rooted in self-reliance,
personal preparedness, and responsibility 
for one’s own survival. These soldiers of survival
and their children could make the 
difference between recovery and the disintegration of
humanity.

81  �How disastrous would a massive 
electromagnetic pulse (EMP) be, 
and what can a survivalist do to 
prepare?
The true effects of an EMP are subject to
considerable debate. A targeted EMP initiated 
by a hostile power would affect a limited area and
recovery could be fairly quick. A larger 
EMP could be the result of a high-altitude nuclear
detonation or a large solar flare. Effects 
could range from temporary outages and scattered
damage to massive destruction of the 
infrastructure and communications systems. In a
worst-case scenario, automotive engines 
would be rendered inoperable; power generators, city
water pumps, and sewage pumps 
would be destroyed; and radios, computers, and phone
systems would be fried. Most of 
the economic wealth that is actually just numbers in
data storage would simply vanish.
Most people tend to focus on protecting their cell
phones and computers from such 
an event. But with cell towers down, there may be no
one to call. Your phone is now 
a paperweight and your computer is just a fancy
typewriter at this point. Loss of the 
internet is the very least of your problems in a
massive EMP event. Having no food, 
water, police, fire, medical, sanitation,
electricity, public safety, or access to your bank 
and credit accounts are your main problems.
The most important electronics in this type of
situation are radios and walkie-
talkies. After an EMP, the national emergency radio
system is the most likely method of 
communication to recover, so you will want to have at
least one AM/FM/MX/GRMS 


--- Page 190 ---
radio protected. Even better, have a multiband or
shortwave radio protected. It’s also wise 
to have a laptop computer, along with regularly
updated flash drives of your whole hard 
drive, to permit recovery when and if the internet is
replaced.
Most government and major commercial data servers are
enclosed on grounded 
Faraday cages. These are simply metal enclosures that
are insulated from the equipment 
they protect and grounded to catch and ground the
incoming electrical energy. You can 
buy Faraday cages or Faraday boxes online, but they
are easy to build yourself. A Faraday 
cage works by reflecting the incoming field,
absorbing incoming energy, and creating 
opposing fields to protect the contents. Grounding
the cage or box has little value to its 
protective capacity. An effective Faraday box can be
made by simply wrapping the outside 
of a cardboard box in several layers of heavy-duty
aluminum foil. In this case, the foil 
reflects and conducts the energy and the cardboard
insulates the devices inside from the 
foil. A steel ammunition box lined with rubber or
foam makes an excellent Faraday box, 
while providing protection from other sources of
damage. Grounding of a Faraday box or 
cage is not necessary, but will absorb the energy
instead of reflecting it.
--- Page 162 ---
146  James C. Jones
Antistatic bags can be used to protect portable
radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones 
in pockets and survival packs. They also protect your
phone data from being copied by 
nearby hackers. These bags should be durable and
should be rated at a MIL-PRF-8170 or 


--- Page 191 ---
MIL-PRF-131 protection level

82  �What items should I carry in an 
outdoor survival kit?
Survival kits are intended to keep you alive, help
you to get back home, and facilitate 
rescue in outdoor emergency situations. They are not
complete survival or evacuation 
packs, but should be carried even if you intend to
just spend the day hiking, fishing, or 
hunting. You can be injured, lost, ill, or get caught
in an unexpected weather event. These 
supplies would be carried in a multi-compartmented
backpack or light daypack. You may 
want to trim it (pick and choose items) for your own
needs, but do not overlook shelter, 
warmth, water, and signaling capabilities.
List:
  1.     1 quart (minimum) water
  2.     1 bottle of water-purification tablets and/or
water-filtration straw
  3.     1 miniature survival manual or survival cards
  4.     1 miniature compass
  5.     1 signal whistle
  6.     2 flares and/or orange smoke bombs
  7.     1 multi-tool or Swiss Army knife
  8.     1 durable Space Emergency Blanket or
disposable emergency blanket
  9.     1 plastic rain poncho
10.      1 stainless steel Sierra Cup or canteen cup
(to heat water, etc.)
11.      1 can of Sterno or 6 to 8 heat tablets
12.      1 magnesium fire starter
13.      1 small LED flashlight
14.      2 tea candles
15.      1 pen and 6 index cards to write notes
16.      1 12" x 24" sheet of folded HD aluminum foil


--- Page 192 ---
(mirror, heat reflector, etc.)
17.      2 vacuum-packed energy bars and/or candy,
jerky, etc.
18.      1 N95 dust/mist mask (dust, cold air, etc.)
19.      1 small first aid kit with assorted
bandages, pain relievers, antiseptics, etc. in a 
plastic bag
20.      Map of the area you are traveling
--- Page 164 ---
148  James C. Jones
Optional:
1.       1 wool stocking cap
2.       1 pair of heavy socks
3.       1 weapon (e.g., pepper spray, .22-caliber
pistol, etc.)
Inspect Your Emergency Supplies Regularly!
There is nothing worse than reaching for your
emergency equipment when you really 
need it and finding that critical equipment and
supplies are not usable. Batteries leak 
and decay, food goes stale and loses nutrition, and
plastic, cloth, and rubber can weaken. 
Dampness and mold can get in. Inspect your emergency
supplies at least every six months. 
Replace and rotate in fresh items as needed. Update
and upgrade your equipment.
--- Page 165 ---
149
83  �How important is it to have 
survival items immediately 
on hand when an emergency 
develops?
It’s what you have with you that counts in an
emergency. What you have in your pockets 
or a small survival kit is far more important than
what you may have at home if you are 


--- Page 193 ---
caught somewhere else when disaster occurs. The items
in your pockets and maybe a 
survival kit will be all you can depend on if you are
lost in the wilds or caught in a blizzard. 
Most people spend more than half their time on the
road or at a job. If you are one of 
those persons, then you must have items with you to
help you get through immediate 
hazards and reach home. You also have to consider the
possibility that you will not be able 
to get back to your home and your main supplies.
Whistles, dust respirators, flashlights, 
survival blankets, compact food and energy items,
extra prescription medications, self-
defense devices, small knives, bandanas to make
bandages and tourniquets, and fire-
starting devices are just a few items that are good
to have.
--- Page 166 ---
150
84  �Why is having bleach on hand 
important in survival situations?
Household bleach is a powerful disinfectant
containing about 6 percent chlorine. In water, 
it will be important for maintaining health when
water supplies, sanitation services, and 
medical help may be unavailable. Here are some uses.
Decontamination
Make a 10 percent solution in water to disinfect
biologically contaminated clothing and 
equipment. This solution can be sprayed in a mist
from an aerosol bottle or from a garden 
sprayer to decontaminate larger area.
Waste Disposal
A 10 percent or stronger solution can be added to
bags or pails of human waste prior to 
sanitary disposal.
Water Purification


--- Page 194 ---
Tap water is usually pure as is. Well water may or
may not contain some biological 
contaminants. Containers may also be contaminated. To
be safe, rinse out the containers 
you are going to store water in with a 10 percent
bleach solution before filling. Add eight 
to ten drops of bleach per gallon to any potential
contaminated water, mix and let stand 
for fifteen minutes before use. For one-quart
canteens and water bottles, add two to four 
drops of bleach, shake, and be sure that the cap and
lip of the container are wetted. Then 
seal and wait fifteen minutes before use
Wound Cleansing
For preparation of Dakin’s solution used to flush
deep wounds as below:
1.       Boil 4 cups of clean water for fifteen
minutes.
2.       Add ½ tsp of baking soda and let cool.
3.       Add 3 ounces of bleach.
4.       Store in sealed container protected from
light.
--- Page 167 ---
151
85  �What are some other methods of 
purifying water?
Access to clean, safe water is the foundation of
survival capability. Whether it’s a massive 
disaster or a wilderness survival emergency, being
able to access and purify water will be 
your most critical need. In addition to storing water
at home and including some clean 
water in survival kits and packs, the survivalist
must be able to gather and purify water 
from various sources. Roof water gathered in rain
barrels, rain water, condensation, melted 
snow, puddles, groundwater, streams, and ponds may
have to be collected, filtered, and 


--- Page 195 ---
decontaminated prior to use. Outdoor lakes, streams,
and ponds will almost always be 
contaminated. During major disasters, municipal water
supplies may be contaminated as 
well. Rainwater gathered in clean containers should
be safe unless a nuclear or chemical 
incident is involved. Roof water will pick up animal
feces and other contaminants.
Boiling
Boiling is generally the best method of purification
and is preferable to using bleach or 
iodine. Bringing water to a rolling boil for one full
minute is sufficient to purify water. 
Boiled water often tastes flat. Shaking or pouring
back and forth can restore natural taste.
Bleach and Chlorine
If access to fuel for boiling is limited, then
bleach, chlorine tablets, or iodine tablets must 
be used.
Filtration
Turbid or cloudy water can be filtered through cloth
or coffee filters before boiling or 
adding bleach.
Iodine
Iodine is an alternative to using bleach to purify
water. It does make a less desirable taste 
and can be harmful if overused, but is effective. It
can be purchased in tablets or you 
can use basic, medical tincture of iodine at two
drops per quart of water. For cloudy and 
highly polluted water, use up to ten drops per quart.
Sunlight UV Exposure
Sunlight can be used to kill most waterborne
biological contaminants. The method 
involves simply exposing the water to direct sunlight
and letting the ultraviolet rays 
--- Page 168 ---
152  James C. Jones


--- Page 196 ---
disinfect the water. UV-A light devices are sold for
this purpose. In a survival situation, 
you can just use the free sunlight and some clean,
clear plastic bottles to do the same 
in an emergency. Six hours of exposure to direct
sunlight by this method will kill the 
following bacteria: Escherichia coli, Shigella
flexneri, salmonella, Yersinia enteroclitica, 
Campylobacter jejuni, and Vibrio cholerae. It will
also work well against rotavirus and 
giardia. This method will also kill the
Cryptosporidium parasite as well, but at least ten 
hours of exposure to full sunlight is required in
order for that to work. The water source 
can be a pond, puddle, or roof water. This rain
barrel contains relatively clean-looking 
water, but bird and animal droppings and decaying
plant matter in the gutters have 
probably contaminated it with biological hazards.
Water may contain various dirt and 
particulates that need to be filtered out before
pouring into a small pint or quart, clear 
plastic bottles no larger than two liters. Glass
bottles filter out most of the UV-A rays and 
larger bottles will not let the UV-A rays reach all
of the water so they cannot be used. 
The six-hour exposure time assumes that there is
direct and full sunlight. Under cloudy 
conditions, it may take up to two days to ensure
effective purification. The bottle is laid 
out horizontally in the sunlight. The use of aluminum
foil or other reflective backing is 
not necessary, but it will increase the effectiveness
of the UV-A exposure.
This clear plastic bottle placed in the sun for six
hours can 
remove biological contamination from water. The
addition 
of the aluminum foil can increase the effectiveness
of this 


--- Page 197 ---
method. 
Commercial Filter
Commercial water-filtration and purification devices
are available for home emergency 
use and should be one of the first purchases in a
home preparedness program. Small 
filtration units, canteens, and straws are made for
outdoor use and must be included in 
every survival kit and pack.

86  �How can I determine someone’s 
medical condition without medical 
instruments?
While having a stethoscope, sphygmomanometer (blood
pressure monitor), thermometer, 
and other devices is handy, we all have diagnostic
tools in the form of our senses of sight, 
smell, hearing, and touch. Here are some examples:
•       
Pinch the skin on the back of the patient’s hand. It
should recover quickly. If it 
remains tented for more than a second, the patient is
probably dehydrated.
•       
Pinch a fingertip. The color of the nailbed should
promptly return to pink. If 
it remains pale or bluish, there is poor circulation
and impending shock.
•       
Feel for a radial pulse at the wrist. If you feel one
there, the patient’s systolic 
blood pressure is at least 90 mm Hg. If there is no
radial pulse, then feel for a 
pulse at the side of the neck. If a pulse can be felt
there, then the patient has 
a systolic blood pressure of at least 60 mm Hg. No
carotid pulse indicates the 


--- Page 198 ---
need for immediate CPR.
•       
Use your fingers to palpate the radial pulse at the
wrist. This should be from 
60 to 80 beats per minute for adults and faster for
children. Pulse rates that 
are higher or lower indicate medical issues. Lack of
a radial pulse is a sign of 
serious shock or heart failure.
•       
Respiration rates for adults should be from twelve to
twenty breaths per minute 
and can be counted by observing the chest rise and
fall. Breathing rates in 
excess of twenty-four or below twelve breaths a
minute usually indicate serious 
medical issues.
•       
Establishing the victim’s level of consciousness is
the easiest and most 
important diagnostic action anyone can take. There
are four levels of 
consciousness. These are: Alert, Verbal, Painful, and
Unconscious, or AVPU.
•       
Asking a patient if they can state their name, the
day of the week, and their 
location can determine their level of consciousness.
If they can provide the 
correct answers they are termed as being alert. If
they cannot answer, but 
do respond in some way to your question, then they
are responsive to verbal 
stimulus. If they do not respond to speech, you can
pinch the patient’s arm. If 
they react to this, they are reactive to painful
stimulation. If they do not react, 
then they are truly unconscious; this is a very bad
sign. Continuously talking 
to a trauma victim is important. Their level of


--- Page 199 ---
consciousness may decline 
rapidly as shock or head injuries progress.
--- Page 170 ---
154  James C. Jones
•       
If a victim is found to be alert, immediately ask
about how they were injured, 
what medications and medical issues they have, who to
contact, and what they 
may be allergic to. If consciousness declines, this
information will be important 
to responding medical personnel.
•       
You can determine if a limb is deformed, discolored,
or swollen by observation. 
If in doubt, compare its appearance to the opposite
uninjured limb. If they do 
not match, it is probably fractured or sprained, and
should be splinted.
•       
You can determine if a patient has a fever by placing
the back of the hand on 
their forehead, then pausing and comparing it to how
your forehead feels.
•       
Use a flashlight to determine if a patient’s pupils
react normally to light. Shine 
a light in one and then the other. Pupils should
contract quickly. Failure to 
contract may indicate use of drugs, head injury, or
poisoning. Pupils that 
remain wide usually indicates deep unconsciousness or
death. Pupils that react 
differently from each other indicate a serious head
injury.
•       
Skin color is an obvious indicator of health. Pale
skin indicates poor 


--- Page 200 ---
circulation. Pale or bluish (cyanotic) skin color is
a sign of insufficient 
oxygenation from shock, respiratory problems, or

87  �Can superglue be used to close 
wounds?
The short answer is yes. While surgical glue is
available, normal commercial superglue 
can be used to close straight, shallow lacerations.
It is not recommended for deep cuts, 
jagged tears, or lacerations on joints. Wounds must
be disinfected and free of debris 
before gluing. Be alert for signs of infection. Add
superglue and some butterfly bandages 
to your first aid kit for closing wounds.

88  �What can I do to survive a major 
epidemic?
An international pandemic is both the most feared and
most probable cataclysm facing 
civilization. Most experts agree that it is not a
matter of “if” but “when” a worldwide 
epidemic of a serious disease will occur. Such an
event would be as devastating to civilized 
societies and the world economy as a nuclear war.
In addition to the accidental, incidental, or
deliberate initiation of a pandemic, a 


--- Page 201 ---
pandemic could be a secondary effect of a primary
disaster. A financial collapse would 
cause civil disorder that could result in the
interruption of sanitation systems, medical 
services, water purification, and food production and
delivery. All of these occurrences 
would open the door to communicable diseases.
Additionally, a nuclear war could result in radiation
sickness that compromises the 
immune system and exhibits many of the symptoms of
communicable diseases to begin 
with. A large-scale natural disaster, an
electromagnetic pulse (EMP), or a cyberattack on 
the power grid could also trigger a domino effect
that would lead to an epidemic.

The chart below includes all of the essential
information about the most likely epidemic 
sources for your reference. Note that radiation
sickness is included to fill the last two 
columns. While it is not a communicable disease, this
does provide a useful basis for 
comparison of effects, and radiation exposure reduces
one’s immune system.

*Mortality rates are highly dependent on the age and
general health of the victims, as well as on 
prompt available care.
**The effectiveness of antibiotics depends on the
victim’s condition and on how soon that 
medicine is administered. In some cases the
antibiotics may not directly affect the disease, but 
may treat secondary infections and thereby improve
the recovery rate.
Surviving a Contagious Disease Epidemic
Although not always listed specifically, almost all
communicable diseases can cause 
some combination of nausea, vomiting, loss of
appetite, sweating, and diarrhea. These 
conditions lead directly to severe dehydration that
in turn results in organ failure and 
death if not treated. Maintaining good oral hydration
and electrolyte balance in the early 
stages of these diseases is critical. Once the
patient can no longer tolerate oral fluids and/
or is unconscious, oral fluids must be avoided and
only IV and rectal (fluid enemas) are 
feasible. Maintaining hydration and the use of
antibiotics where effective can greatly 
reduce mortality rates for most of these diseases.
The single most effective defense against being
infected is the ability to restrict or 
eliminate all contact with the population and sources
of contamination as soon as possible. 
Once symptoms are detected and the word of an
epidemic is spreading, you must be able 
to instantly isolate yourself and your family, and


--- Page 211 ---
continue to remain isolated until the 
epidemic has burned itself out. Being able to stay
safe in your home for four to eight 
weeks with enough food, water, medical supplies, fire
extinguishers, defensive arms, and 
--- Page 175 ---
150 Survival Secrets  159
lighting and heating capacity is the only sure way to
avoid becoming a victim of deadly 
pathogens. The places where you are most prone to
exposure are public transportation 
hubs, grocery stores, hospitals, and disaster aid
centers. If other potentially infected 
persons attempt to enter your home, you are justified
in turning them away and using 
force if necessary to protect your own life and the
lives of your family.
In a worst-case situation where you are forced to
evacuate your home or are unable to 
get to your home, you will need to have survival
packs and skills that allow you to survive 
for an extended time without aid or contact with
others. Water filtration, respiratory 
protection, safe food, and defensive arms will be
especially important to survival in the 
open.
Anything and anyone coming into contact with you
during an epidemic should be 
considered dangerous. Wearing N95 respirators when
you are away from home or while 
caring for afflicted family members is essential. All
water (regardless of sources) should 
be boiled for five minutes or treated with bleach at
a quarter teaspoon per gallon. Wear 
latex gloves when handling any potentially
contaminated items and use a spray of 10 
percent bleach/water solution to decontaminate
surfaces, canned goods, and any other 


--- Page 212 ---
potentially contaminated items from outside.
The use of latex gloves, hydration solutions, N95
respirators, bleach 
solutions, and available antibiotics shown above
could provide a 
significant advantage in surviving a large-scale
epidemic.
--- Page 176 ---
160
89  �There is so much to prepare for 
and so many different kinds of 
emergencies; where do I start?
Remember the old Chinese proverb: “The best time to
plant a tree plum tree is twenty 
years ago; the second best time is today.” The same
is true of survival preparedness and 
education.
True survivalists are seldom at a zero preparedness
state. Furthermore, increasingly 
frequent and violent disasters produces new
survivalists every day. The sudden realization 
that you are vulnerable to life-threatening events
and have neither the skills nor the 
equipment to care for yourself and those you care
most about can be alarming. The scope 
of the preparedness challenge may be overwhelming and
even lead to paralysis of action. 
Any action is better than no action and even the
smallest preparedness steps are far better 
than nothing at all.
Put away five to ten gallons of water for each family
member. Start allocating canned 
goods to be kept for emergencies. Determine to add a
week’s worth of nonperishable food 
(e.g., canned, pasta, beans, rice) to your survival
stocks every month or two. Buy more 
candles and a good flashlight. Don’t forget a fire
extinguisher and a battery-powered 


--- Page 213 ---
AM/FM/WB radio. Buy or create evacuation packs for
all family members. That’s pretty 
simple stuff, a task which anyone can complete
without spending a lot of cash. Doing just 
these things gives you a good base in an emergency
and starts you on the road to greater 
self-reliance. If you are already a full-fledged
survivalist, this is how you can advise and 
help your neighbors to get started.
--- Page 177 ---
161
90  �When can a survivalist use deadly 
force?
Some images of survivalists propose that they are
trigger-happy individuals, anxious for a 
shoot-out. This is the opposite of good survival
thinking. Getting into a situation where 
deadly force of any kind is involved should be
avoided whenever possible. Retreating, 
rerouting, taking cover, and being aware of threats
is far safer than any armed or physical 
combat situation. Even trained combat shooters get
killed sometimes. Survivalists do not 
go looking for trouble, but they are always ready
when trouble cannot be avoided. In such 
cases, the use of a firearm or other device to
disable or kill an assailment can be justified 
and necessary.
You are justified in shooting an assailant when an
armed or physically superior 
individual is moving toward you and are within twenty
feet of you and do not stop. This 
rule is based on the fact that a charging assailant
closer than twenty feet can reach you 
with a fist, knife, or blunt weapon and do serious
harm before you can pull the trigger or 
before your shot can stop them.
You are justified in shooting an assailant whenever


--- Page 214 ---
they attempt to employ a firearm 
in order to do you or others bodily harm. You are not
obliged to wait until they point the 
weapon at you or anyone else, and you are certainly
not obliged to let them shoot first. 
You will need to prove that they had hostile
intentions and you had reason to fear for your 
life. If they have not drawn their weapon, you may
elect to warn them that if they reach 
for their weapon you will fire.
Assailants do not have to be armed to justify the use
of deadly force. They just have 
to be obviously capable and having intentions of
physically harming you. A 240-pound, 
twenty-two-year-old assailant threatening a seventy-
year-old man or a 120-pound woman 
justifies the use of deadly force. Multiple
assailants that outnumber the potential victims 
usually would justify deadly force.
In most states, you are justified in using deadly
force on any intruder that enters your 
home regardless of whether they are armed or not.
Under normal circumstance it is better 
to call the police and take up a position to defend
yourself and your family than it is to 
go looking for a confrontation. However, if they come
after you, then your justification 
is clear.
You are usually not justified to use deadly force in
defense of property alone. You 
cannot just shoot someone who is stealing your car.
If you confront a thief on your 
property and put yourself between them and the
property or if they chose to assault you 
instead of running away, then you can use deadly
force. But remember that initiating a 
deadly force confrontation is always dangerous and
legal justification may be difficult.
The use of deadly force and the killing or wounding
of another person, no matter 


--- Page 215 ---
how justified, is a traumatic experience for most
individuals. Even when morally justified 
--- Page 178 ---
162  James C. Jones
and obviously necessary, it can cause emotional
distress. Regardless of the circumstances 
there is going to be an investigation. You will be
interrogated and you may even be 
arrested. Don’t move anything, don’t say anything,
and cooperate with the police, but get 
a lawyer. Even the most obvious self-defense cases
can have complications.
--- Page 179 ---
163
91  �Should a survivalist be trained in 
hand-to-hand combat?
Most survival situations are more likely to require
non-combat-related skills such as first 
aid, water purification, food acquisition, escape
techniques, or shelter building than hand-
to-hand combat. Many survivalists will lack the
physical capability to be proficient at this 
kind of combat; but all survivalists should have some
level of armed-combat capability 
as their first option.
Immediate, effective actions are essential to hand-
to-hand combat. Such reflexes can 
only be achieved when constant training has implanted
each move into muscle memory. 
While reading a book about combat techniques or
watching demonstrations is better 
than nothing, only professional training and physical
conditioning will provide one with 
real capabilities. Such training takes time and
dedication. If you do elect to take self-
defense training, be sure to use a reputable and


--- Page 216 ---
professional provider.
Basic self-defense training is often offered by local
police departments and other 
agencies. This usually focuses on breaking holds and
escaping from various criminal 
assaults. This kind of training is recommended for
women of all ages, but is limited to 
crime prevention, not survival combat.
A true survivalist avoids physical combat except in
defense of life and freedom and 
only if no other option is available. As with armed
combat, the stakes are kill or die so 
survival combat training should focused on delivering
blows that immediately disable or 
kill the aggressor. Martial arts forms that emphasize
throws, holds, and pins are of limited 
value in true mortal combat. Fist-fighting and
wrestling skills that work in competition 
are not enough when no rules apply.
In these situations, armed always beats being
unarmed. Don’t hesitate to use a 
firearm, knife, club or improvised weapon (spray can,
rock, stick, thrown sand in eyes), 
if assaulted.
If you are forced into a situation where you are
cornered, grabbed, or forced into a 
physical-contact fight and you have no immediate
weapon, there is always some part of 
your body that is free to strike the assailment and
there is always a critical part of the 
assailment’s body that is open for you to hit hard.
Your weapons:
•       
Your head is hard. You can smash a nose, knock out
teeth, and hit other areas 
to telling effect.
•       
Your elbows can strike forward and back at the head,
face, abdomen, and 
groin.


--- Page 217 ---
•       
Forearms are hard bones that can swing to block and
strike hard.
--- Page 180 ---
164  James C. Jones
•       
Wrists are better than fists against many targets.
•       
Knees are powerful and tough. They can be used
against the groin, head, 
abdomen, or other available target.
•       
Feet can kick forward and back as well as stomp.
•       
Hands can grab, pull, push, and gouge.
•       
Palms can strike at ears and chins.
•       
Fists can be used like hammers or to punch.
•       
Teeth can bite ears, fingers, and other tissues.
Your enemy’s target points:
•       
Ears can be bitten. A hard palm strike to one or both
ears can rupture the 
eardrums and disorient the assailant.
•       
Eyes are vulnerable to finger pokes, thumb gouging,
and elbow strikes.
•       
The nose can be struck by the head, elbow, or fist.
An upward drive below the 
nose can be lethal.
•       
The jaw and teeth can be broken by a head-butt,
elbow, or fist.
•       
A hard blow to the throat can crush the trachea and


--- Page 218 ---
prevent breathing 
temporarily or even permanently.
•       
Hard blows with the fist, elbow, knee, or head to the
center of the abdomen 
below the rib cage will usually disable an assailant.
•       
The kidneys on each side of the abdomen are
vulnerable to hard kicks, knee 
strikes, and punches.
•       
Any strike to the groin will disable a male
assailant.
•       
Fingers can be bitten, smashed, and bent until they
dislocate
•       
Kicks and strikes to the knee joint or the elbow
joint in the opposite direction 
that it normally bends will disable that extremity
and usually the assailant as 
well.
•       
Shins and arches can be kicked.
Consider your body as a collection of weapons and
your enemy’s body as a collection 
of targets. The one who uses the best weapons against
the most vulnerable targets most 
effectively will win. Hesitation and slow responses
will usually result in being seriously 
injured or killed. Since mortal combat is the only
kind of survival combat, you cannot 
leave a temporarily or partially disabled assailant
or assailants behind to attack you or 
others again. Under normal circumstances they must be
disarmed and restrained until 
the police can take custody, but under extreme
survival situations further actions may be 
necessary to prevent future assaults.

92  �How can I survive emergencies in 
the outdoors?
Most survivalists engage in some kind of outdoor
activities such as hiking, fishing, 
camping, or hunting. In some cases, survivalists
engage in high-risk activities such as 
whitewater rafting, caving, rock climbing, or cross-
country skiing. These are excellent 
survival-skill-building activities, but they can
generate serious survival emergencies in 
themselves if proper safety precautions are not
taken. Here are some basic outdoor safety 
rules that should always be followed.
1.       Always tell someone where you are going,
what your intended route is, and when 
you plan to return. Failing to do so is probably the
number-one cause of people 
dying in the outdoors.
2.       If possible, always travel with one or more
companions. If one of you is injured, 
the other can provide aid or go for help. The
preferable minimum number for 
any high risk or off-trail activities is three
capable adults. In an emergency, one 
can provide help for the victim while the third goes
for help, or two can carry 
the victim.
3.       Know your limitations. You are not an expert
in everything. Listen to those 
who are more experienced. When you are in a new
region or environment, pay 
attention to locals. A swamp survivalist is not a
desert survivalist and a “country 
boy” may not survive in the city, and vice versa.
4.       Don’t be afraid to speak up. If a route
looks dangerous or the weather is turning, 
or if for any reason you think caution or turning


--- Page 220 ---
back is advisable, then say so. 
Ego and pride should never be allowed to put you or
others in danger.
5.       Use extra caution when using knives, axes,
and other devices that can cause 
injuries. Even a minor injury can be fatal when help
is not immediately 
available.
6.       Watch where you step. You can easily twist
an ankle, break a leg, or sustain a 
serious fall. In some regions, poisonous snakes may
be a hazard as well. Being 
disabled in the outdoors is far more hazardous than
at home. Carrying a 
walking stick is an excellent idea.
7.      
Always, always carry a survival kit with some form of
protection from wind and 
rain such as a rain poncho, survival blanket, or
tarp. The kit should also include 
flares, a whistle, a signal mirror, energy bars,
water flashlight, waterproof 
matches, and first aid items. You should always have
a knife of some kind when 
in the outdoors as well.
--- Page 182 ---
166
93  �With the availability of modern 
GPS devices, why does a 
survivalist need to know basic 
map and compass usage?
While GPS systems are certainly effective and fairly
reliable, a true survivalist should 
always be ready to navigate without the aid of GPS.
Even a very basic compass can 
be useful in finding your way in the outdoors.
Dependence on GPS is not a good 
survival practice. The survivalist must still know


--- Page 221 ---
basic compass usage and have good 
map-reading skills. A compass is of little help if
you suddenly realize that you are lost, 
unless you have some idea of which way that you need
to go to return. Unless there 
are good visible landmarks, it may be difficult to
orient your map, find your location, 
and determine your route, unless you have used the
map throughout the trip. Normal 
walking always leads us in a curved path, causing us
to circle, even when we think we are 
going straight. Once lost, it is essential to have a
way of determining and maintaining a 
direct route to safety.
In all but the most remote locations, just
maintaining a straight line of travel will take 
you to a road, river, trail, railroad or other route
to safety. Establish a compass bearing 
that you intend to maintain as a route, then use the
compass sight to establish a target 
such as a prominent tree, hilltop, or rock formation.
Proceed to that point and then sight 
on another landmark on that same bearing and repeat
the procedure. If you have followed 
a compass bearing to your destination, you 
can then simply add or subtract 180 degrees 
to that bearing to get the return route. For 
example, if your bearing on the way from 
your vehicle to a cabin was 330 degrees, 
then the return bearing to follow would 
be 150 degrees. Moving through wooded 
and rough terrain along a bearing will 
usually result in some deviations, so you 
may not get back to the exact spot where 
you started, but should get close enough to 
see the destination or be at a point along a 
road, trail, or river to guide you to it. If the 
distance to the baseline (road, trail etc.) is 
considerable, you may want to set a return bearing a
few degrees to the left or right of 


--- Page 222 ---
the exact 180-degree return course so that you know
which way to go when you reach it.
This compass is sighted on a tree at about 80 
degrees (slightly north of straight East). 
--- Page 183 ---
150 Survival Secrets  167
Even if you have no compass, you can establish the
direction that you think will be 
most likely to get you to a road, trail, town, or
other desirable location and then take a 
sighting on three lined-up landmarks and then go to
the middle one and establish the 
next further landmark that aligns with the other two
and repeat the process to keep 
moving in a relatively straight course.
--- Page 184 ---
168
94  �How can I determine direction when 
I do not have GPS or a compass?
Determining direction without the benefit of a
compass can be difficult, time consuming, 
and unreliable. Even the cheapest compass is better
than having to use these methods, 
but you should know them as last resort. But watch
out for old wives’ tales. The idea that 
moss always grows on the north side of a tree is
generally false, especially in thick forests 
and damp areas. Moss is more apt to grow on the north
side of trees that are in the open 
in dry climates. Here are a few common techniques you
can rely on for determining 
directions.
Finding the direction using your analog watch
1.       Hold the watch flat in your hand or palm.
2.       Rotate the watch until the hour hand points
in 


--- Page 223 ---
the direction of the sun.
3.       Between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. (standard time) a 
line dividing the distance between the hour 
hand and twelve will point true south.
4.       Disregards the position of the minute hand.
Stick and shadow method of determining direction
This method is only usable in sunny weather and when 
you have time to wait for the shadows to move.
1.       Drive a stick into the center of a flat open
area 
of ground.
2.       Drive a stick at the very tip of the shadow
cast 
by the first stick.
3.       Swing a circle around to an equal distance
and 
angle opposite the second stick. Place a third 
stick at that point.
4.       Wait until the shadow moves around to the
last 
stick.
5.       Draw a line from the center stick through a 
point halfway between the other two sticks.
6.       This line will point due north.

95  �What is a key consideration 
in survival preparedness and 
emergency action?
The key is to happen to it before it happens to you.
This is a survivalist’s life mantra. Of 
course, things will still happen to you, but
constantly moving ahead of survival issues 
(and life issues) reduces the probability of many
personal and local survival problems. 
Obviously, disaster preparedness is a key part of
happening to future events, but 
maintaining your health and building personal
economic stability, as well as involvement 
in community preparedness, crime prevention, and
safety measures are all important 
parts of proactive survival actions. There is a lot
more to survival than just having a pack 
and a plan.

96  �How can I survive an active-
shooter situation?
An “active shooter” is someone who initiates a
shooting and either remains at the scene 
or in motion, while shooting multiple rounds at
multiple victims. Active shooters target 
crowded locations such as stores, theaters, airports,
and public buildings where every 
round fired may potentially hit one or more victims.
If caught in this type of situation, 
you can be sure that the killing will continue until
the police engage the shooter or the 
shooter has killed everyone in sight. Even the police
have admitted that civilians caught 
in such situations should take certain actions rather
than stay calm or try to reason with 


--- Page 225 ---
the terrorists. Below are steps and actions that you
can take to survive such an event.
Being Prepared for a Potential Active Shooter
•       
Be observant and alert! In any crowd, you must
observe for suspicious 
behavior. Are people wearing unnecessarily baggy or
long clothing? Do some 
people have suspicious bulges in their clothing or
are they carrying odd long 
packages? Are some people wearing backpacks or
leaving backpacks or bags 
behind? Are some people moving around suspiciously
and looking about as if 
getting ready to take some action? If your sixth
sense is telling you to get out or 
get down, then do it!
•       
Make an escape plan. In a restaurant, shopping mall,
theater, or other public 
building, make sure to constantly be aware of the
location of all exits. Exits can 
be fire doors, windows, over railings, or anything
that gets you out. Consider 
routes to all the exits that offer the most
bulletproof cover. If true escape is not 
safe, then seek any room with a solid door that can
be locked and barricaded 
with heavy furniture.
•       
Identify potential bulletproof cover. While you may
hide behind furniture, 
car bodies, or plaster walls, these will usually not
stop bullets. They provide 
only concealment. Bulletproof cover is offered by
brick walls, cement walls, 
heavy appliances, engine blocks, and other very solid
objects. Constantly 
identify these as places to go if escape is not
immediately available.


--- Page 226 ---
What to Do When the First Shots are Fired
•       
Act immediately! If you have accepted the possibility
of an active-shooter 
situation and taken the steps above, you can move
from denial to action while 
other hesitate and become victims.
--- Page 188 ---
172  James C. Jones
•       
Take cover. If you are already in the shooter’s
vision or if there is no covered 
escape route that will not expose you to the shooter,
this may be your only 
option. Get behind the strongest, thickest object
possible immediately. Stay 
low or lie flat. If you are wounded or among those
who are wounded, lie 
down and play dead. Shooters will instinctively shoot
anyone they see who is 
moving.
•       
Escape. If the shooter(s) has their back to you, or
you are out of their 
immediate vision, you have a chance to escape or at
least reach good cover 
before they turn around. Remember that there may be
more than one shooter. 
If you go through a door, get to the right or left of
the door immediately and 
keep moving toward any cover, since the shooter may
shoot through the door 
or follow you out the door. If you choose to run,
leave your belongings behind 
and keep your hands visible and fingers spread.
Remember that you will be 
running toward police who do not know you from the
shooters. Do not stop 


--- Page 227 ---
to ask the officers for information. Avoid pointing
and screaming. Others 
outside the building may be unaware of the situation
inside and could be about 
to enter. Tell them that there is an active shooter
and to get away from the 
building.
•       
Hide and barricade. If you cannot exit the building
safely, your next best 
option is to get into a securable room. Turn off the
lights. Be sure everyone’s 
cell phone is on silent. Block the door with anything
available and get out of 
sight. Quietly call the police and tell them where
you are.
•       
Engage. Police agencies have now recognized that
civilians may need to take 
action on their own before law enforcement arrives to
save themselves and 
others. If you cannot escape or find cover and the
shooter continues to shoot, 
your best chance is to distract, delay, or disable
the shooter. Discharging a fire 
extinguisher, throwing a heavy object; tackling,
clubbing, or stabbing are all 
justified in this situation. If you have a firearm,
use it! Yes, shoot them in the 
back if necessary. Shoot for the head as they often
have bulletproof vests. If 
possible, shoot from a low position so your bullets
go upward and avoid hitting 
bystanders. Don’t hesitate and don’t try to get them
to surrender. They will just 
shoot you. CAUTION: Remember that the police will
consider anyone they 
find holding a gun as the enemy! Once the shooter(s)
are down do not pick up 
their weapon(s), and put your weapon down and your


--- Page 228 ---
hands up and wait for 
the police.
•       
Communicate. If not in immediate danger, use your
cell phone to call 
for help. Provide the police with any information
that you can, such as the 
description and number of shooters, location of the
shooters, and the type of 
weapons being used. If you are barricaded or behind
cover, provide your exact 
--- Page 189 ---
150 Survival Secrets  173
location and your own description. The police will be
getting a lot of calls, so 
you may get put on hold or even get disconnected. If
nothing else, pull the fire 
alarm to warn others and distract the shooter.
•       
Recovery. If you are lucky enough to have survived
such a violent event you 
are not safe yet, since police are going to be very
jumpy upon entry. Shooters 
have been known to hide among victims, and then
escape or open fire at 
the police. The police will consider everyone present
to be a potential threat 
until they are searched, interviewed, and cleared.
Follow police instructions 
carefully. Raise your hands and spread your fingers
immediately. Keep your 
hands visible at all times. Do not reach for your
cell phone or any other object. 
Avoid making any quick movements toward the officers.
If you are carrying 
a firearm (open or concealed) be sure to immediately
tell the police while 
keeping your hands up.


--- Page 229 ---
•       
Help others. If safe to do so, direct others to
escape or to shelter. If you have 
any medical training try to help the wounded until
the medics arrive. Stop 
severe bleeding by immediately applying direct
pressure over the wound and/
or applying a tourniquet above the wound. Treating
for shock may be an 
important lifesaving action.
Recognition of a Potential Active Shooter
In most cases, active-shooter situations could have
been prevented if others had recognized 
and reported the shooter’s actions and mental state
in advance. The next active shooter 
could be a family member, fellow employee, or
neighbor. If you know or encounter 
someone with one or more of the following traits,
contact authorities, employers, and 
psychological support organizations immediately. Do
not confront or argue with such 
individuals.
•       
Obsession with extremist and violent political or
religious ideas combined with 
interest in and access to firearms or explosives.
•       
Increased anger at others such as employers, family,
or religious groups.
•       
Talk of revenge or getting even.
•       
Increased mood swings, absenteeism at work, drug and
alcohol use, and 
depression.
•       
Paranoia, hostility, and withdrawal.
•       
Obsessive interest in violence, firearms, and
explosives.

97  �What do I need to do to survive a 
worldwide economic collapse?
The world’s economic system is so interconnected that
any number of situations could 
trigger a total collapse of the system. War, a
massive electromagnetic pulse, a large-scale 
cyberattack or any combination of natural and man-
made disasters can easily trigger 
a financial disaster. Even if there is no traumatic
collapse, the world economy is likely 
heading toward a poorer and impoverished general
condition. Any economic collapse (slow 
or fast) would trigger a number of other survival
challenges. Civil disorder, revolution, 
martial law, epidemics, and even war would probably
be initiated. The failure of food 
supplies, police, and municipal services might even
be a result of a failed economy.
Obviously the value of stocks, bonds, and cash will
decline or evaporate completely. 
Since it is impossible to predict how soon a collapse
will occur, it would not be wise to 
abandon solid investments and savings, but these
should not be your only economic 
holdings. Shifting enough of your wealth to hard
assets that could provide for your needs 
through a prolonged situation is a wise precaution.
You must be able to live and make 
a living even if all of your investments and savings
were gone and you are permanently 
unemployed. Avoid any dependence on Social Security,
pensions, annuities, or disability 
benefits as these can be lost as well. Can you still
have shelter, food, water, and other 
essential needs after those income sources are
depleted? Do you have trade goods and skills 


--- Page 231 ---
to barter for what you need? Do you have the means to
recover and rebuild a personal 
economic foundation in a post-collapse society? Your
overall disaster preparedness and 
self-reliance capacities should be helpful, but in a
chaotic economy and governmental 
collapse, you will need a far deeper survival system.
Real estate is a collapse-proof investment. Buildings
provide shelter, a base for post-
collapse business, and storage space for survival
supplies. Land (even a backyard) can 
be used to produce food, gather water, and even camp
on. Real estate can be rented or 
bartered when nothing else can. In a collapsed
economy, land is the new gold, but it must 
be owned, not mortgaged. Mortgaged and rented
property will be repossessed quickly by 
banks and the state because of its value.
Nonperishable trade goods including survival gear,
storable foods, fuel, batteries, tools, 
firearms, ammunition, toilet paper, medications,
water-filtration products, blankets, 
coffee, razors, clothing, shoes, soap, toothpaste,
and cleaning products will be high-value 
trade goods. Garden seeds and gardening tools will
come in demand as well. Some people 
will trade a lot for alcoholic beverages and
cigarettes despite their low survival value.
The best trade and barter item that takes up no room
is your skills and capabilities. 
The proverbial “handyman” will be more valuable than
any lawyer or banker after a 
collapse. Medical technicians, nurses, auto
mechanics, gunsmith, skilled fisherman and 
hunters, and those who know how to sew, can, garden,
forage, and fix things will be on 
--- Page 191 ---
150 Survival Secrets  175


--- Page 232 ---
top of the social and economic ladder. Those with the
ability to transport goods will 
also be in demand. Being able to bring in fuel, farm
products, and other critical goods 
in exchange for bartered goods and services will be
survival traders. If fuel runs out, 
bicycles, boats, and even horses could of great value
in moving goods.
Arguably, the most important resource in surviving a
general financial collapse will 
be your survival network. Your family, friends, and
neighbors will form your survival 
economy. Building up skills, supplies, and plans with
the people around you will be the 
key to success.
Surviving a long-term and widespread failure of the
economy will be the ultimate 
test of determination and survival skills. Whether
civilization recovers as a happy and 
free society or withers into a depressed and
oppressed remnant will depend on how well 
survivalists mange the challenges.
--- Page 192 ---
176
98  �How should a survivalist interact 
with the police?
The media often portrays survivalists as the enemies
of the police. People who are involved 
in criminal activities or are confrontational with
police are not survivalists. Survivalists 
are not involved in criminal activities, so your
interactions (if any) will involve minor 
issues such as traffic stops or mistakes. The list
below provides some helpful tips on what 
to do to avoid being pulled over, and what to do if
you are pulled over.
•       
Since the media often gives the wrong impression


--- Page 233 ---
about survivalists and 
gun owners, avoid having “Don’t Tread on Me,” pro-
NRA, or other bumper 
stickers on your vehicle as this may automatically up
the level of tension.
•       
If you are armed or have a firearm in the vehicle,
tell the officer immediately 
what it is and where it is. Whatever you do, don’t
reach for it!
•       
If you are not in a safe location to pull over, slow
down, turn on your 
emergency flashers, and drive slowly to the nearest
shoulder or driveway.
•       
If pulled over, stop your vehicle in safe spot, lower
the driver’s-side window. 
Turn off the ignition and place both hands on the
steering wheel.
•       
Follow the officer’s instructions slowly and
carefully.
•       
Answer questions and provide your driver’s license,
vehicle registration, and, if 
applicable, your carry permit.
•       
When interacting with police, it is important to
understand the “ladder of 
authority” rule. The officer will always act to
assert a level of  of authority 
slightly above that of the citizen. If the officer
starts by using polite tones and 
respectful terms and you respond with abusive
language, the officer will then 
become forceful. If you escalate to any kind of
threats, then the officer must 
prepare to use force. Any aggressive action on your
part requires the officer’s 


--- Page 234 ---
use of corresponding force and probably a call for
backup and an arrest. Just be 
cool and polite.
•       
You could be pulled over by several police vehicles
with full lights and siren 
and they get out with guns drawn. They may be
responding to a violent crime 
committed by someone matching your description or
driving a similar vehicle. 
Stop immediately. Do not get out of your vehicle.
Keep your hands in sight. 
Obey all instructions. This is a very dangerous
situation that happens often in 
urban areas.
•       
The police do not have the right to search your
vehicle without probable cause 
or a warrant. The loophole is that if they casually
say “you don’t mind if we 
--- Page 193 ---
150 Survival Secrets  177
check your trunk” and you say “okay” you just gave up
your rights. If you say 
“no,” they may become a bit hostile but they are not
likely to go for a warrant 
without evidence. Of course, if you’re sure you only
have a spare tire in there, 
it’s up to you.
•       
Understand that an officer cannot let a potentially
dangerous or armed 
suspect just run away. Someone who has just committed
a violent assault, has 
a weapon, or has threatened to harm others cannot be
left to endanger the 
community. The officer that abandons a pursuit or
lets someone run off is held 


--- Page 235 ---
responsible for that person’s next crime. This is
called “failure of duty.” The 
officer is not obligated to tackle or wrestle with
armed or physically superior 
suspects. Disabling or using deadly force is usually
justified. Driving away or 
running away (guilty or not guilty) seldom ends well.
•       
If the police think that you may be a suspect or
person of interest and start 
asking you questions related to a crime, ask them,
“Am I under arrest or am I 
free to go?” If they were just fishing they have to
let you go, but if they have 
“probable cause” they may arrest you. Stop talking
and get a lawyer.
While survivalists by nature are independent and
averse to authority, we recognize the 
value and necessity of police officers. Most police
officers are respectful of citizens’ rights. 
Many survivalists are also police officers.
--- Page 194 ---
178
99  �How can a survivalist survive in a 
gang-dominated neighborhood?
Many urban areas are controlled by gangs, who in turn
may be soldiers of drug cartels. 
Most small-town and even rural areas have a growing
gang presence within their 
populations. There are more than fifty gangs with
over 68,000 members in Chicago 
alone. Nationwide gang membership outnumbers the US
Army and National Guard. 
These organizations drain hundreds of millions of
dollars from the economy while killing 
thousands of Americans. Since these gang members are
sometimes unwitting employees 
of uber-wealthy and powerful drug cartels, the gangs


--- Page 236 ---
can easily arm their street soldiers 
with weapons, regardless of what prohibitions are
imposed on the citizens. Gangs have 
also infiltrated the military and have the knowledge
to use highly potent weaponry if 
general disorder breaks out. Once law and order
breaks down, these gangs will ravage 
their own communities and spread terror far into
adjoining regions. Nascent gangs in 
smaller towns and rural areas will become aggressive
and will be an added challenge to 
surviving most disasters.
Surviving in a Gang-Controlled Area
If you are unfortunate enough to live in a gang-
controlled community, then being a 
survivalist is a daily challenge rather than just a
future possibility. The fact is that the 
police only control the spot they stand on while they
are there, but at all other times the 
streets, alleys, stores, and homes belong to the
gangs. Those who do not do drugs are 
often considered with suspicion or are treated as
outcasts. Residents are frequently unable 
to disavow gang members and criminals within their
families. Talking to the police or 
reporting criminal activity is an invitation to being
injured or even killed. Having a job, 
money, or nice possessions is often derided and
victimized. And perhaps most troubling 
of all, children are constantly tempted and
intimidated by gangs, drugs and viciousness.
You are already living in a disaster zone, and
preparedness for additional disasters is 
extremely challenging. Survival in such communities
is a special skill. Compromising and 
recognition of gangs may be necessary as long as you
minimize your actual involvement. 
Keeping as low a profile as possible is critical.
Appear passive and peaceful, but do 
not become an easy target. You must keep your


--- Page 237 ---
children away from drugs and gang 
membership at all costs.
Participate and support any community efforts to end
violence and drugs. Avoid 
direct “anti-gang” confrontations. Gang retaliations
can involve violence against you and 
your family members. Regardless of the laws or what
others tell you, you must be armed. 
Since burglaries are a common gang activity, you
should keep the fact that you own a gun 
or guns confidential. It is especially important that
you keep firearms away from children 
--- Page 195 ---
150 Survival Secrets  179
and adolescents. If they don’t know you have them,
they will not tell others or be under 
peer pressure to get hold of them.
If you can escape a gang-controlled area, then do so,
but be aware that gangs have a 
long reach and often follow families to new
locations. You will have to detach yourself by 
abandoning all friendships, affiliations, and even
family members who are still involved 
with gangs. If law and order break down, law-abiding
citizens must have a plan to 
evacuate if possible or fight for survival in place.
Families, religious organizations, and 
other organizations should plan for such situations
in advance.
Preventing Gangs from Taking Control
If you live in a suburb, town, or rural area, do not
assume that you are safe. Only 
awareness and preventive action can ensure that you
will not find yourself in the grip 
of gangs. There is no disaster that will be more
devastating than allowing gangs to take 
over your community. Complacency, procrastination,
and denial of gang infiltration will 


--- Page 238 ---
breed crime, violence, decay, and destruction in your
community.
An increase in graffiti, petty crime, and drug usage
in your community are the leading 
indicators of gang invasion. Immediate removal of
graffiti, as well as the active persecution 
of shoplifting, drug possession, and other crimes
must be insisted upon. Community 
support and involvement is essential. All schools
should have DARE antidrug programs 
and active community crime watch programs that call
police at the slightest suspicion; 
these programs will discourage criminals. Building
codes and strict requirements for 
property maintenance will prevent the development of
gang hangouts and drug houses.
Get involved in your community. Insist on strict law
enforcement. Support your 
police and all anti-crime programs. Your safety,
property values, future, and loved ones 
all depend on it. Once in control, these gangs are
well-armed, organized, and ruthless. 
Don’t wait until you have to battle them in your
streets.
Survival Challenges Near to Gang-Controlled Areas
As economic conditions worsen, gang-promoted crime
tends to spread farther out from 
urban areas. Street crimes, home invasions, and
assaults target the less-prepared residents 
who have more valuables. Carjacking and robberies are
common in gang-controlled areas 
and nonresidents are more attractive targets.
Shopping areas and parking lots become 
hunting grounds for all kinds of criminals. During a
true survival situation, these dangers 
multiply significantly. Being aware, prepared, and
armed is a necessary responsibility for 
a survivalist in such areas. The ability to stay off
the streets and defend your home and 
family by all necessary means is especially important


--- Page 239 ---
when looting and lawlessness breaks 
out in such areas.
Gangs must be considered as terrorists and serious
survival threats even during 
normal times, and must be taken into account in any
disaster planning. Serious efforts 
to eradicate this problem remain politically
unacceptable. The existence of gangs and 
--- Page 196 ---
180  James C. Jones
their activities will continue to degrade our society
until some situation generates a 
massive confrontation or until they become the
dominant force in our society, as they 
have in many South American countries. This should be
prevented at all costs, as local, 
regional and federal governments in gang-controlled
nations are coerced and bribed into 
cooperating with them, leaving citizens with no hope.
--- Page 197 ---
181
100  �If I am on a very tight budget, 
how can I prepare for survival 
situations?
If you are already struggling to get by, it can be
challenging to cope with the possibility 
of a disaster situation. The survival market is full
of costly supplies and equipment that 
many people just cannot afford. The survival rule of
BTN applies to those on a budget. 
“BTN” means that having something is “better than
nothing.” While having significant 
funds for preparedness is certainly desirable, being
short on cash is no excuse for not 
being able to improve your survival chances. Set a
budget and set aside or spend that 


--- Page 240 ---
amount every month for survival-related items or
supplies. Here are some ways to build 
your survival capacity on a tight budget:
•       
The most important survival supply you can have is
water. Do not waste 
money on bottled water. Clean out large beverage
containers with bleach water 
and then fill them with tap water. Seal them well.
Water does not spoil, so this 
costs you nothing.
•       
Food is the next high priority for survival. Grocery
stores often have cans with 
dents or torn labels on sale. Products such as pasta,
dried bean, rice, and oats 
that are “expired,” are often still good for years,
if kept sealed. Check out local 
food pantries for free storable food items to build
up your supplies.
•       
Thrift stores often have used camping items, sleeping
bags, and clothing.
•       
Yard sales are a great source of camping supplies,
stoves, lanterns, and other 
survival supplies.
•       
Dollar stores have candles, batteries, lamp oil, and
other items at low prices.
•       
Military surplus stores and catalogs are a source for
high-quality knives, tents, 
sleeping bags, stoves, packs, clothing, and even
survival foods. Military gear is 
as good as or better than sporting goods items and is
usually much cheaper.
•       
Flea markets are a good place to find all kinds of
survival gear and a great way 


--- Page 241 ---
to develop contacts and develop bartering skills for
an alternative economy.
•       
While brand-new firearms purchased from reputable
dealers are best, you are 
better off having a good used weapon than none at
all. Gun shops and gun 
shows often have a good variety of reasonably priced
handguns and rifles. Try 
to stick with established brands (e.g., Colt, Smith &
Wesson, H&K, etc.) and 
have someone who knows how to evaluate a firearm help
you make a wise 
selection. You do not want an excessively worn or
defective weapon when 
--- Page 198 ---
182  James C. Jones
your life depends on it. Reloaded ammunition from a
reliable dealer is usually 
cheaper than new, name-brand ammo.
•       
Explore eBay and other internet sources but be aware
that these sites are 
rampant with scammers and all of your purchases will
be recorded by various 
agencies.
Even if you have adequate funds, there is no point in
wasting money on overpriced brands 
when you can use the saved funds for other supplies.
Good budgeting and wise spending 
are key survival skills.
--- Page 199 ---
183
101  �How can I build up a survival 
library?
Every survivalist will have differing needs for


--- Page 242 ---
survival knowledge. No one can remember 
everything they need to know to survive in every
situation, so it is essential that a survivalist 
assemble a library of reference and instructional
books as part of an overall preparedness 
program. While websites, search engines, and online
videos are useful tools, they are 
not a substitute for well-written and illustrated
volumes. Storing survival knowledge on 
electronic devices or depending on access to the
internet in a disaster contradicts basic 
survival reasoning.
The choice of survival reading should be based on
what is anticipated and the most 
probable challenges. Someone living in an urban area
would need to have books on 
self-defense, crime survival, home preparedness, and
basic disaster situations, but would 
not need to know much about wilderness survival, fire
building, or animal trapping. 
Someone who lives in more rural areas or spends a lot
of time in the outdoors (e.g., 
camping, fishing, hiking) may need more traditional
books that cover outdoor survival 
skills. A basic first aid manual is a good place to
start. There are many books on surviving 
natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes,
floods, and earthquakes that would apply 
to almost everyone. Military “survival” 
manuals are usually slanted toward 
outdoor and escape-and-evasion skills, 
but some also cover nuclear, chemical 
and biological survival. Once you have 
the basic survival information for getting 
through the most likely situations 
with water, food, shelter, and other 
essentials, you can start buying books 
that enhance your longer-term needs. 
Advanced medical skills, foraging, 
gardening, bartering, food preservation, 


--- Page 243 ---
and general self-reliant living is your 
“phase two” library. Do not overlook 
books that address the psychological 
and philosophical aspects of survival. 
Will and mental conditioning are as important as
supplies and skills. Reading stories 
of how others survived disasters or being lost
throughout history can be entertaining, 
inspirational, and educational.
Building up a good variety of books about outdoor and
home emergency survival can be essential. You cannot 
be dependent on the internet for information once a 
disaster situation is in progress. 
--- Page 200 ---
184
102  �Should trade and barter be part 
of a survivalist’s skill set?
Our modern society has become so accustomed to price-
and-pay acquisitions that the 
paradigms of trade and barter have been lost to most
of the population. Short-term 
disasters and emergencies seldom require such skills,
but a general financial collapse or 
long-term disaster would certainly generate such
opportunities, in triggering what is 
called survival wealth. Survival wealth means that
you have everything you need, and 
also a lot of what others may need or want after a
disaster. As essential supplies run out 
and emergency aid agencies fail to provide for needs,
those who have both stocked up 
sufficiently and put aside extra supplies of trade
goods to build their survival economic 
system, survive better and recover faster. Those who
did not prepare will be willing to 
bargain for essential goods, but many will also be
ready to use violent means to take 


--- Page 244 ---
what you have. If you are bartering out in the open,
you likely will attract attention. The 
would-be survival trader must put a heavy emphasis on
security and armed defense.
Some of the goods available on the barter market are
likely to have been stolen or 
looted, and the dealers are likely to be armed and
prepared to take what you have without 
any trade. Be aware of this and know who you are
dealing with. It is best to have armed 
companions and deal in a safe location.
If you have adequate funds to build up a barter stock
and an adequate and secure place 
to store them, here are a few suggested items.
•       
water-purification tablets and filters
•       
Oil lamps, lamp oil, and candles

103  �Is basic home safety a necessary 
part of survival preparedness?
Being prepared for a major disaster will do little
good if you or your family experience 
a serious injury or personal disaster because of poor
safety practices at home. Over 
15,000 people die each year in the United States as a
result of home accidents. The great 
majority of these deaths are preventable. Conducting
a home safety inspection monthly 
can significantly reduce the chances of you becoming
one of those statistics. Focused 
inspections are much more effective in actually
identifying hazards. The list below is by 
no means a complete list of potential hazards, but
can help identify the most common 
hazards found in the home. Think “what if” and assume
a “worst case” situation as you 
go through each room. Safety and survival are
inseparable practices.
Tripping and Falling Hazards
•       
Are there loose carpets or throw rugs, exposed
extension cords, items on the 
stairs, or worn stair treads that could cause a fall?
•       
Are railings on stairs loose or broken?
•       
Are damaged ladders and step stools still in use?
•       
Do the tub and shower have grab bars installed?
•       
Are your sidewalks free of cracks and holes?
Fire Hazards
•       


--- Page 247 ---
Are there working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors
in the basement, 
hallway, and each bedroom?
•       
Does your family have a fire evacuation plan that
everyone knows and has 
practiced?
•       
Do you have fire extinguishers in the workshop,
garage, and kitchen?
•       
Are flammables stored outside the house or in fire-
safe metal cabinets away 
from ignition sources such as furnaces, stoves, and
hot water heaters?
•       
Is your fireplace inspected and does it have a good
screen to catch sparks?
•       
Is your furnace professionally inspected annually?
•       
Are there exposed or frayed wires or plugs?
•       
Are all appliances grounded with three-pronged plugs?
•       
Are paper towels, curtains, packages, and aerosol
cans a safe distance from 
stove tops and other sources of ignition?
•       
Are matches, lighters, and other fire starters kept
away from children?

Do you have a phone and flashlight next to every bed?
•       
Do you have a fully stocked first aid kit?

children?
Chemicals and Medications
•       
Are all medications stored out of reach of children?
•       
Are all acids, corrosives, poisons, and flammable
household cleaners kept in 
locked cabinets out of the reach of children?
--- Page 204 ---

104  �Is there any way to reduce my 
stress levels and calm my nerves 
during a survival emergency?
When something really bad happens, we get a surge of
adrenaline that can work for, 
and then against, us. Once we have escaped the
immediate danger, we need to calm 
our nerves so we can perform the next survival
actions. Controlled breathing can help 
reduce shaking, lower blood pressure, and adjust
carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This 
technique is used by police and military going into
combat situations.
1.       Inhale slowly for four seconds.
2.       Hold that inhalation for four seconds.
3.       Exhale slowly for four seconds.
4.       Wait four seconds before inhaling again.
5.       Repeat until you feel calm and in control.
--- Page 205 ---
189
105  �Is being armed necessary for a 
survivalist?
The combat-related aspects of survival are often


--- Page 249 ---
overemphasized by non-survivalists and 
provide a misleading image to the public; however,
being appropriately armed must be 
a part of any realistic survival preparation. As with
all aspects of survival preparedness, 
selection of equipment must be based on anticipated
needs.
For home protection against intruders, one should
select a reliable handgun. If you 
feel the need for legal concealed carry, there are
many small automatic pistols available 
and plenty of safe, concealable holsters. Once you
acknowledge that a civil unrest or 
chaotic evacuation situation is possible, you must
increase your armament. A shotgun 
may be effective as a defensive weapon in urban
evacuations. A medium-caliber, high-
capacity rifle with multiple magazines may be
necessary for defending an assault on 
your home or reacting to threats on the road. Larger-
caliber, high-capacity handguns 
are usually carried as well in these situations. It
is best to stick with common military 
weapons that are durable and reliable, and that use
commonly available ammunition. 
The survivalist should take every opportunity to
practice the use of the survival weapon 
and become familiar with disassembly, cleaning, and
how to clear a malfunction.
The AR-15 style rifle is lightweight and durable. It
uses 5.56 NATO 
ammunition, which is common and plentiful. The rails
permit the 
installation of tactical sights, lasers, and
telescopic sights. The AK-
47 clone below is a bit heavier and a bit less
accurate than the AR, 
but is extremely reliable even without maintenance.
The 7.62 mm .39 
ammunition is also commonly available. 


--- Page 250 ---
Automatic pistols come in all sizes. Left to right:
full-size 9mm, medium-
frame 40-caliber, compact 9mm, and subcompact 380
caliber. The full-
size weapon has a seventeen-round magazine down to
twelve rounds, 
eight rounds, and just six rounds for the subcompact.
Revolvers are easy to use and reliable, have a
limited number of shots 
and are slow to reload. The small .38-caliber
revolver on the left is good 
for home protection and concealed carry, but not the
best for serious 
combat. The large .357 Magnum at the top actually
holds eight rounds 
instead of the usual six. 
--- Page 206 ---
190
106  �If I do not have access to 
prescription pain relievers, what 
are my alternatives?
The overuse of opioids and other potent pain
relievers is highly dangerous. While keeping 
old, unused prescription drugs is generally unsafe,
most medications can be effective 
long after their listed expiration dates and should
not be discarded if a serious shortage 
of medical needs is anticipated. Most over-the-
counter pain relievers can be used a few 
pills beyond their recommended dosages for a short
time, if necessary. Avoid combining 
different kinds of pain medications. One exception is
that two acetaminophen and 
three ibuprofen tablets can be taken together safely,
providing pain relief comparable to 
codeine. It might be wise to stock both in your
supplies.

107  �How can I survive a nuclear event?
While massive nuclear war still remains a
possibility, more confined nuclear events and 
conflicts have become far more probable event. The
effects of an actual nuclear blast 
include massive burns and trauma from blast pressure
and flying debris. A person close 
enough to experience these blast effects and survive
will have been exposed to significant 
and potentially fatal doses of radiation. Radioactive
fallout that blows downwind from 
a detonation or leak can travel for hundreds of
miles, regardless of the source. The most 
probable sources of public exposure to radiation are
described below:
•       
Single or multiple nuclear power plant meltdowns,
such as Fukushima and 
Chernobyl. Such events could result from
cyberattacks, earthquakes, or other 
major disruptions. The safety systems and backup
systems at these plants are 
designed to cope with limited and short-term
disruptions. However, there is no 
such thing as fail-proof. Such events could result in
regional contamination in 
major population areas.
•       
Terrorist initiation of a limited nuclear detonation,
dirty bombs, or the covert 
spreading of radioactive material in public places.
Such events would limit 
exposure to a limited number of people in a limited
area.
•       
Limited nuclear wars overseas are potential scenarios
where a few or even 


--- Page 252 ---
dozens of nuclear weapons could be detonated. Fallout
would travel westward 
to the United States. During the 1960s nuclear
testing by the USSR in Siberia, 
and by France, Great Britain, and the United States
in the Pacific was a regular 
occurrence. Radiation sickness did not affect
Americans, but cancer and other 
illness rates did increase. Limiting any exposure,
particularly in the first weeks 
and months after such an event, would be prudent.
Radioactivity Exposure and Its Effects
The table below provides the estimated effects of
radiation exposure. Note that even 
without the benefit of knowing the dosage in
roentgens (a unit of gamma radiation), how 
soon the symptoms appear, and how many people in the
same area are affected, is a good 
indication of developing disability and fatality
rates. Be aware that disability and death 
rates may vary widely depending on the health and age
of the exposed personnel. Lower 
exposures of fifty to 120 roentgens might be
anticipated from distant events such as 
overseas nuclear exchanges or nuclear power plant
accidents. Being close to or downwind 
of a nuclear detonation or power plant meltdown could
result in exposures from one 
hundred to three hundred roentgens, depending on
distance and how long you spent in 
the contaminated area. Higher exposures would be
limited to those directly in or near 
to a nuclear detonation. Any exposure can increase
your potential for cancer and a host 
--- Page 208 ---
192  James C. Jones
of other medical issues in the future. It is
particularly important to protect children and 


--- Page 253 ---
adolescents from any exposure, as it is more likely
to cause chronic illnesses later on.
Expected Effects of Short-Term Gamma Radiation

Vomiting and nausea will affect about 50 percent of
exposed 
personnel within about twenty-four hours. This will
be followed 
with other symptoms of radiation sickness, but no

Vomiting and nausea will affect nearly all of exposed
personnel 
during the first twenty-four hours. This will be

--- Page 209 ---
150 Survival Secrets  193
Rule of Thumb for Estimation of Total Dosage
Accumulated
D= Dosage in Roentgens
I= Intensity of Roentgens per hour
T= Time of exposure in hours
D= I x T
For example: If the dosage rate is found to be 70
roentgens per hour and you have 
been exposed for three hours, then it is 70 x 3 = 210
roentgens accumulated dosage
Nuclear detonations or accidents will result in the
production of radioactive fallout. 
Fallout is simply radioactive dust that is thrown
upward by the blast. Since the heavier 


--- Page 255 ---
particles fall, first they start falling downwind
closest and soonest after the blast. This 
makes these particle the most dangerous. The finer
dust will fall further downwind over 
days and weeks following the initial blast. All
radioactive fallout is subject to decay in 
radiation, so it is most dangerous within the first
hours and days after it is created, but 
continues to radiate at a declining rate for years.
In the event of a dirty bomb or the covert spreading
of radioactive materials by 
terrorists, radiation levels may vary widely and
exposure areas will be limited to a few 
buildings or a few blocks. Those who may have
aspirated radioactive particulates or 
unknowingly spent extended time in contaminated areas
may develop varying levels of 
radiation sickness.
Understanding Radiation
Fallout debris can range from sand-like particles
that fall close to the source of a nuclear 
event to very fine dust that travels hundreds of
miles from the source. There are three 
sources of radiation exposure from fallout.
1.       Alpha particles cannot penetrate unbroken
skin, but if ingested or inhaled, they 
can reach unprotected internal organs can have
serious effects.
2.       Beta particles can cause beta burns if left
on the unprotected skin and can 
cause more serious damage if ingested or inhaled.
Both alpha and beta exposure 
hazards can be reduced by washing or dusting off
particulates and wearing an 
effective dust mask.
3.       Gamma rays are like X-rays in that they can
penetrate most materials with 
ease. These rays pass through the body, damaging
cells and vital organs. The 
more intense the gamma radiation is and the longer


--- Page 256 ---
the time of exposure, the 
more severe the damage is. In addition to keeping
particulates out and off of 
--- Page 210 ---
194  James C. Jones
your body, you must get out of the contaminated area
as quickly as possible 
and thoroughly decontaminate yourself once out of the
area. All clothing and 
equipment exposed to fallout must be abandoned or
decontaminated. Clothing 
probably will be difficult to clean of all fallout.
Fallout shelters use massive amounts of soil,
concrete, and other materials to reduce the 
amount of gamma radiation from outside that
penetrates into the shelter. Additionally, 
filtering of air reduces the amount of radioactive
material that enters the shelter. The 
more time you spend in such a shelter or even within
a massive building or basement, the 
less your accumulated exposure will be. However, if
the area of contamination is limited, 
such as downwind of a nuclear power plant, prompt
evacuation and decontamination 
would be far more effective than remaining in the
contaminated area in any kind of 
shelter.
Signs and Symptoms of Radiation Sickness
Radiation sickness results from the damage that gamma
rays cause to the cells and organs 
of the body. How soon the signs and symptoms appear
and how severe they are is a good 
indication of exposure rates and potential mortality.
Initial symptoms include nausea, 
irritability, vomiting, diarrhea, and general
fatigue. These symptoms may disappear after 
a few days, but reappear within one to two weeks with
more serious symptoms of hair 


--- Page 257 ---
loss, hemorrhaging, and bleeding under the skin.
Compromised immune systems will 
result in fever, infections, and disability.
Vomiting, diarrhea and internal hemorrhaging 
result in severe dehydration. The sooner that these
symptoms appear after exposure 
the lower the survival rate will be. Radiation
sickness is not contagious. Exposed but 
decontaminated victims cannot “infect” family members
or caregivers.
What to do if you are or think you are being exposed
to radioactive fallout
•       
Get out of the contaminated area as fast as you can
to reduce total exposure 
rates.
•       
Immediately put on a dust mask or improvise a
respirator from dampened 
cloth to keep particles out of the body.
•       
Dust off any contamination on your clothing.
•       
If possible, wear ponchos, raincoats, plastic bags,
or other waterproof and dust-
proof clothing. Be sure to have your head covered to
keep particles out of your 
hair.
•       
Once out of the contaminated area, carefully remove
contaminated outer 
garments. Dust and wash skin, hair, and feet as
thoroughly as possible. 
Remove the dust mask last. Leave contaminated
clothing and material well 
away from shelter.
--- Page 211 ---
150 Survival Secrets  195


--- Page 258 ---
•       
Decontaminate any food cans, utensils, and equipment
before use.
•       
If available, take potassium iodide pills or liquid
per dosage instructions.
Treating Radiation Poisoning
In addition to preventive use of potassium iodine
tablets, there are other measures you 
can take to improve your survival chances and shorten
recovery time.
•       
Maintain hydration with vitamin- and electrolyte-
fortified water. When and 
if oral hydration cannot be tolerated, the use of
intravenous fluids or fluid 
enemas may be necessary.
•       
Strong iron supplements should be given to combat
severe anemia and 
weakness.
•       
Antibiotics should be given at the first signs of
fever or infection as the 
immune system may not be able to fend off even minor
illnesses or infections.
•       
Burns and wounds must be treated with special care to
avoid any kind of 
contamination.
•       
Since internal bleeding often occurs in radiation
poisoning, aspirin should be 
avoided.
•       
Milk of magnesia or Pepto-Bismol may be used to
reduce diarrhea and 
vomiting.
Radioactive Decay and the Rule of Sevens
Although heavily radiated areas can be unsafe for


--- Page 259 ---
decades, most contaminated areas will 
become safer and safer as time passes. This is
because of radioactive decay. Simply put: 
radioactivity declines by a factor of ten for every
sevenfold increase in time after the 
initial event. This is known as the Rule of Sevens.
So after seven hours, the residual 
fission radioactivity declines 90 percent, to one
tenth its level of one hour. After forty-
nine hours, the level drops again by 90 percent. So
now it’s just 1 percent of the lethal 
dosage it was after one hour. After fourteen days, it
drops a further 90 percent, and so on. 
After fourteen weeks, the rate drops even faster.
--- Page 212 ---
196  James C. Jones
The chart figure at right illustrates a 
typical fallout footprint. The size of the 
fallout area footprint depends on the size 
and altitude of the initial dust plume and the 
strength and direction of the wind. If you 
know what happened and where, you can make a pretty
good guess as to what direction 
to evacuate toward. Lowering levels indicate the best
way to go, but if you are moving 
downwind your exposure time will still be higher than
if you move at right angles to the 
wind’s direction.
Radiation Detection Instruments
There are a lot of reasonably priced older dosimeters
and survey meters available. 
Uncalibrated radiation detectors sell for about $20,
while used calibrated survey meters 
sell for about $80 and new ones sell for about $150.
There are also more modern nuclear 
radiation detectors and monitors on the market. These
range in price from $180 to $300.
Regardless of calibration, any detected exposure


--- Page 260 ---
levels ranges or area radiation above 
normal is cause for concern.
Surplus civil defense survey meters such as the CV-
700, 751, or 720 can be purchased at reasonable 
costs. Some are calibrated and others are not, but 
calibration services are also available. These CD 
V-742 pocket dosimeters and CD-V750 chargers 
are also still available. These are used to register 
personal exposure rather than area radiation.
Dosimeters are intended to be worn in the pocket 
and checked frequently to determine how much 
radiation the wearer has been exposed to. They 
come with a charger and instructions. A charger 
and two dosimeters retail for about $40. 
Additionally, potassium iodide is a specific blocker
of thyroid radio-iodine uptake. 
Taking potassium iodide effectively prevents the
thyroid gland from being saturated with 
harmful radio-iodide from fallout contamination that
can lead to cancer. Fourteen 130 
mg. potassium iodide pills retail for about $20.

197
108  �What kind of pack should I use 
for my evacuation and survival 
packs?
The selection of a pack depends on your budget and
the situations you anticipate using 
it in.
A basic evacuation pack is intended for short-term
endurance, and so carries limited 
contents. This is basically a day pack. It still
should be reasonably durable and comfortable 
to carry. A pack in a teardrop shape with well-padded
shoulder straps, which can hold 
fifteen to twenty pounds, is sufficient.
A true survival pack must be a larger, high-quality,
multi-pocketed backpack with, 


--- Page 261 ---
wide comfortable shoulder straps and preferably a
waist belt to distribute the load. There 
are plenty of good military and commercially designed
bags meeting these specifications. 
Be sure there are attachments and/or pouches on the
front straps for you to place items 
such as a compass, weapon, knife, etc. that you may
need in a hurry. The pack should 
also include plenty of outside pouches for small
items and tie-downs to secure sleeping 
bags and ponchos. The size of the pack should match
your carrying capacity and survival 
needs. Avoid bulky outdoor packs with frames as they
are designed for trail hiking, not 
survival and escape situations. Smaller waist or
butt-bags are good for a field survival kit 
or backup survival, kit to keep in your vehicle.
Although military-style packs are well 
designed for survival, they tend to attract attention
that you may want to avoid. There 
are a lot of non-camouflage packs and even luggage
that comes with shoulder straps that 
may work for you. These usually come in dark and
subdued colors as well.
A variety of survival and evacuation packs. The small
survival kit hanging on the tree would be okay 
for short-term emergencies. The tan pack below could
be a bugout bag or evacuation bag. The larger, 
camouflaged bag in the center would be a full
survival pack. On the right is an inconspicuous
carry-on bag 
used as a small survival pack and a small, green day
pack that could be an inconspicuous evacuation kit. 
--- Page 214 ---
198
109  �What should a survivalist do if 
lost or stranded in the outdoors?
Being lost in the woods is the classic survival


--- Page 262 ---
situation. Many people die each year 
from exposure, dehydration, and other causes related
to having become lost in various 
outdoor environments. Such problems are not confined
to amateurs. Even experienced 
survivalists can get in trouble when they become
complacent or overconfident. Most of 
these problems can be avoided by letting others know
where you are going, what your 
route will be, and when you should be returning.
Using a map and compass to maintain 
constant knowledge of where you are is far easier
than finding your location once you 
realize you’re lost. A survivalist could be forced to
flee into an unfamiliar area or take an 
off-trail route for various reasons. The unprepared
can be caught in a sudden rainstorm 
or blizzard. You could be injured or disabled and not
be able to get back to civilization 
or your camp.
A true survivalist is never lost. You may not be able
to identify your location on the 
planet and others may not know where you are, but you
are right there and you own that 
place and situation.
Take charge, evaluate your situation, resources, and
capabilities, and make decisions.
In most normal “lost” situations, it is recommended
that you stay in place and wait 
for rescue.
This assumes that rescuers will know that you are
missing and they will know where 
to look for you.
Thrashing around and exhausting yourself is
definitely not a good plan. If you are 
sure that rescue is not likely, make a plan and take
a route that maximizes your chances 
of reaching help.
Because humans have a dominant direction, you will
always walk in a circle unless 


--- Page 263 ---
you can move toward an easily visible landmark or
follow a terrain feature to maintain 
a straight line. If no landmark is visible, you can
maintain a straight line of travel by 
lining up three trees or other landmarks in a row.
Walk to the second tree and then line 
up the trees behind with another tree. If you can
follow a straight line long enough, 
you will usually intersect a road, trail, railroad
track, or stream that you can follow 
to civilization. Creeks run into streams, and streams
run into rivers. Follow flowing 
water when possible. Try climbing a tree or hill to
spot landmarks that you can move 
toward. Following the slope of the land downhill
usually leads to roads, streams, and 
towns. If you camp until dark, you may be able to see
light from houses or towns or 
headlights moving on distant roads that were not
visible during daylight hours. Towns 
and highways also cast a glow on the clouds that may
indicate a promising direction 
to go toward. Take bearings and head in that
direction after dawn. Night travel is 
hazardous and should be avoided.
--- Page 215 ---
150 Survival Secrets  199
Regardless of your intentions to stay put or walk
out, you must not permit yourself to 
become exhausted, dehydrated, wet, or cold. If it is
raining, snowing, or you are caught 
with inadequate clothing, shelter and warmth are your
first priorities. You may have to 
wait out a rainstorm or blizzard and conserve your
strength before trying to travel. In 
such cases shelter building and that survival kit
will be lifesavers.


--- Page 264 ---
--- Page 216 ---
200
110  �How can I signal for help if 
lost, stranded, or injured in the 
outdoors?
Attracting attention is the first priority. In many
cases just the sight of smoke, the sound 
of a whistle, a red flag, or gunshots will cause
investigation by someone. Three dots, 
three dashes, and another three dots is Morse code
for SOS. Three well-separated fires, 
three smoke sources, three timed whistle blasts,
three gunshots, three fires, three smoke 
columns, or three flashlight blinks will be
recognized by most as a distress call. A large 
“SOS” laid out with clothing or branches, or dug into
the sand can be used to attract 
rescue aircraft.
The man is sighting through the hole on the military
signal mirror 
found in his survival kit. Any reflective object can
be used in an 
emergency.
--- Page 217 ---
201
111  �What is the single most important 
survival tool a survivalist can 
have?
There is no single item that defines, establishes,
and sustains an individual’s survival, 
self-reliance, and freedom more than the knife. The
knife and, its predecessor the spear, 
was in use long, long before the arrow, sling, or
firearm. Flint blades predate almost any 
other man-made device. In fact, the identifier
“Saxon” in the term Anglo-Saxon comes 
from the name of the long, heavy-bladed knife called


--- Page 265 ---
the seax, which was often carried by 
the Anglo-Saxons. Carrying the seax was the mark of a
free man. Slaves, of course, were 
prohibited from carrying arms.
Today, virtually everyone uses some kind of knife in
their daily lives. The possession 
of a knife imparts a huge survival and self-defense
advantage to anyone. If you have 
nothing else with you, a knife gives you a chance to
survive. Not carrying a knife of some 
kind is essentially surrendering your survival
potential to luck and the whims of nature 
and man. The prepared person will carry a pocketknife
or a pouch knife throughout the 
day. He or she may keep a larger survival knife or
hunting knife in their vehicle or other 
accessible location.
Further, there should be a well selected set of
blades for outdoor activities stashed in a 
survival pack. One may carry a heavy four- to six-
inch blade length belt knife for heavy 
work. A small thin-bladed pocketknife for fine work
and maybe a Swiss Army–type 
knife or multi-tool with a variety of blades and
gadgets as well. Some multi-tools even 
have LED flashlights and fire starters included. Some
“survival knives” come with a 
match compartment in the handle and a compass in the
butt. These are good for backup 
caches or extra knives, but most are weakened by the
hollow handle and may break 
during heavy survival use. (The exception will be
covered later in this chapter.) You may 
want to consider one of the military bayonet/knives
that work with the sheath to cut wire. 
Going cross-country in most areas will mean crossing
a lot of wire. The M9 and M10, 
as well as the AK-47 bayonets, all have wire cutters.
Small sharpening stones are often 
included in a pouch right on the sheath. This is a


--- Page 266 ---
highly recommended feature. A blade 
that goes dull or breaks when you need it most is no
bargain, but there are overpriced 
knives where you are simply paying for style or a
brand name. Ultimately you have to 
select your knife set based on as much quality as you
can afford. Survival and self-reliance 
knives can be classified as pocketknives, pouch
knives, sheath knives, and combat knives. 
The following are some recommended selections from
several knife experts.
Pocketknives are single- or several-bladed knives
that fit into a pocket comfortably 
and unobtrusively. For our purposes, we can narrow
down the description further to 
imply that a pocketknife is a single or double-bladed
knife of no more than three-inch 
--- Page 218 ---
202  James C. Jones
blade length. You want this knife to be thin 
and light so you can carry it comfortably at all 
times, but you also strong and sharp. You may 
want a double-bladed knife so you can have 
both a larger and a smaller blade. In addition 
to your primary carry knife, it’s a good idea 
to have cheaper, small knives in every jacket 
pocket, or even a small one on your key chain 
so you always have something as a backup.
Multi-tool devices are handy. They include 
pliers, wire cutters, and other devices that can 
have important survival applications. These 
are usually too bulky for the pocket, but come 
with a belt pouch. Many of the devices require 
that you open them in order to access the knife 
blade inside. The knife in this configuration is 
too hard to access and clumsy to wield. Get 
one that has the knife blade accessible without 
opening the plyers, or carry a separate knife.


--- Page 267 ---
Pouch knives are those that are carried in a 
belt pouch or may be kept in other places, but 
are too large for comfortable pocket carrying. 
This includes large folders, Swiss Army knives 
and multi-tools. If your normal apparel is work 
clothes or blue jeans, you may be able to wear 
a belt pouch without attracting any negative 
attention. This provides the opportunity to 
carry larger and more versatile knives.
Sheath knives are larger, carried blades 
ranging 
from 
the 
short-bladed 
USAF 
Survival Knife, to the US Marine KA-BAR, 
to machetes of lengths of twelve inches or 
greater. The actual military surplus USAF 
Survival Knife and US Marine KA-BAR are 
good values. Oversized knives are generally 
not needed. So-called survival knives that 
have hollow handles for storing matches and 
survival items are generally cheap and apt to 
break in hard use, but can be used in backup 
kits or as “better than nothing” options.
Other Blades: In most cases a good 
pocketknife, sheath knife and multi-tool is a 
Left to right: A small low-cost, two-bladed 
pocket knife. Basic lock-blade pocket knife and 
high-end knife with seat-belt cutting notch, 
safety-lock, and belt clip.
Multi-tool device and Swiss Army knife. Both 
have a variety of devices and blades. Newer 
versions of the multi-tool have blades that open 
and lock from the outside like a regular pocket 
knife making them much more effective. 
Top: Air Force survival knife; bottom: K-Bar style 
survival knife. Both knives are ideal for survival 
situations where strength and durability are
critical.

150 Survival Secrets  203
complete blade set for a survival situation, but 
in the backwoods and forests heavier cutting 
instruments may be helpful. Hatchets and 
small axes can be attached to the survival pack 
for use in constructing shelters and cutting 
firewood. Short machetes are useful both for 
clearing brush and small trees, and for building 
shelter. Get a machete with a good sawblade 
on the back. The saw can be helpful in many 
survival tasks. There are also combination axe, 
shovel, and saw tools that may fit your needs.
Combat knives are specially designed for 
fighting and so are not ideal for other survival 
uses. Combat knives range from small, 
concealable three-inch blades and throwing 
knives to boot knives and “commando” 
knives. While knife fights are possible, they 
are not probable.
Leaving knives out is an invitation for 
trouble. They can be lost, stolen, damaged, 
picked up by children, or even used against 
you. Keep them in their sheath or pouch and 
in a safe location when not in use. Clean and 
lightly oil multiblade knives so they open 
freely when you need them. Knives are not 
intended for prying or hammering. Keep your 
knives sharp and clean. Learn how to properly 
sharpen all of your knives.
Your choice of a knife will depend on both your
anticipated uses and your worst-case 
emergency needs. No one knife will be the best for
every situation. You should have at 
least one high-quality pocketknife, pouch knife, and
sheath knife, and carry all three 
if possible when in a potential survival threat
situation. Carry more than one knife if 


--- Page 269 ---
possible. Cheaper knives that are stashed in various
locations (e.g., vehicle, office, pack, 
etc.) will be far better than nothing if you are
unable to access your primary blade.

112  �How can I survive a disaster 
if I live in an apartment or 
condominium?
People living in an apartment or condominium are at a
huge disadvantage compared to 
those living in a separated house or duplex. An
apartment resident’s survival chances are 
dependent on the actions or inactions of the other
residents. Once a fire starts or looters 
are given access to one apartment, all hope of
survival is lost. These risks are amplified if 
the survivalist resides on an upper floor and/or in
an urban area. Unprepared residents 
are liabilities at best and will likely be a source
of danger to the survivalist. The more 
tenants there are, the greater the hazard. The wise
survivalist should seek the lower floor 
of a small apartment building with only six to eight
other apartments. Most apartments 
usually do not have enough room for storing large
quantities of water, food, and other 
supplies. Municipal water, sewers, heat, and gas are
more likely to fail and alternatives are 
much harder to provide in an apartment dwelling.
Certainly short-term utility interruptions, storms,


--- Page 270 ---
or other “normal” emergencies can be 
coped with by having a few gallons of water, several
days’ worth of food, candles, flashlights, 
and other supplies on hand, but more severe or
extended situations will usually make 
sheltering in place untenable. Once other tenants and
neighbors become desperate and civil 
disorder breaks out, you may be trapped and
overwhelmed. The capacity to evacuate with 
or without a vehicle must be a priority for
apartment-dwelling survivalists. Evacuation has 
considerable risks, but it likely to be necessary
when a true, long-term, large-area disaster 
develops. Since you are more likely to need to fight
off looters and even fight your way out 
of the building and out of the area, the apartment
survivalist should give more attention 
to weapons. In addition to a handgun for 
personal home and street protection, a short 
shotgun with self-defense or buckshot loads 
may be necessary. You will also need to stock 
and carry more ammunition. If you are stuck 
anywhere above the second floor you must 
have an alternative way to get down. Escape 
ladders and even strong knotted ropes should 
be part of your supplies.
If you must consider sheltering in 
place, it may be worth the effort to 
gradually introduce your fellow tenants to 
preparedness and defense without letting on 
that you are ahead of them.
The previous Mossberg 500, twelve-gauge 
“camper” model came with a pistol grip (no 
stock). This was easily replaced with an Advanced 
Technology folding stock and a five-round shell 
holder. This could be a good choice for the 
apartment-dwelling survivalist that may need to 
deal with multiple assailants and threats. 


--- Page 271 ---

113  �Is camping an important activity 
for a survivalist to engage in?
The classic image of a survivalist is of someone out
in the woods by a campfire or in 
a tent. In truth, the majority of survival scenarios
do not relate to camping situations, 
and many survivalist are focused on surviving
assaults, fires, long-term self-reliance, or 
other non-camping-related issues. Camping may not be
practical or affordable for every 
survivalist. However, camping and acquiring camping
skills and equipment can certainly 
enhance survival capacity in many ways.
Backpacking and primitive, out-of-the-pack camping is
a healthy hobby and a huge 
benefit for those for whom long-term evacuation from
civilization may be necessary. 
A few backcountry hikes and camps test both your
capabilities and equipment, and is 
highly recommended for those who can do it.
Domestic camping at a campground or state, or
national park is valuable to any 
survivalist individual, family, or group as it
provides an opportunity to build unity 
and teamwork while actually using self-reliance
skills and equipment. Many essential 
survival items are also camping items. Camp stoves,
tents*, camp heaters, sleeping bags, 
water filters, packs, axes, and dehydrated foods are
necessary items for home survival as 
well. Camping also requires one to have sturdy boots
and outdoor apparel that will be 
important in many survival situations. Fire building,
navigation, camp cooking, tracking 
and other outdoor skills have survival application as
well. Taking up hunting, fishing, 
and edible plant foraging can enhance your camping
and survival skills greatly.


--- Page 272 ---
The ability to camp in winter and other cold-weather
conditions should be the goal of 
the camping survivalist. If you truly believe that
you may have to camp out or even camp 
at home in an emergency, you must consider that such
a situation can occur at any time of 
the year and last for an extended time. Tents,
sleeping bags, clothing, and other gear that 
are sufficient for mild weather may be completely
inadequate for rain, snow, or freezing 
cold. Camping in these conditions is the only sure
way to find out.
The camping experience builds confidence and a true
sense of self-reliance beyond 
just reading and buying equipment. An experienced and
well-equipped camper will be 
far ahead of the non-camper in many emergency
situations.
*Tents may be erected inside a home to conserve
warmth in cold weather when electricity and fuel 
are interrupted.

114  �How can I control my fear in an 
emergency and control my fears 
of future events?
Fear and anxiety are unavoidable elements in any
survival situation, and therefore both 
deserve special attention when managing our mental
state. One definition of fear is that 
it is a psychological and biological reaction to real
or perceived threats to life. Of course, 
we all fear bodily injury and death, but we may also
have fear for other people or fear for 
the loss of property or freedoms. Fear can manifest
itself in many ways. The knot in the 
stomach, the inability to concentrate, the urge to
run, headaches, loss of sleep, nausea, 


--- Page 273 ---
and loss of fine motor skills are some manifestations
of fear. Fear is normal and must be 
expected and accepted. Fear can save you or doom you
depending on how you manage 
it. Sometimes fear is an indicator of what you should
avoid. At other times, the thing you 
fear is the very thing you must do to survive. If the
object of fear didn’t matter it would 
not be feared, therefore it requires action and
management by you. Fear should stop you 
from taking unnecessary and foolish risks. Fear
should not misdirect you into harm’s 
way. Fear should not be allowed to get between you
and an objective of worthy value.
Fear begins with our physical and psychological
environment. Each person has his 
or her own list of potential threats. The nature of
these threats depends on many factors 
including the immediate situation, age, knowledge,
health, financial situation, past 
experiences, vocation, lifestyle, and location among
other factors. You may be expected to 
fear the smoke coming in under your bedroom door or
of losing your job, but regardless 
of the understood expectation, you are still afraid.
This is where the threat or no-threat 
response comes into play in order to determine an
appropriate response. There are three 
states of threat response: ignorance, awareness, and
preparedness.
Ignorance may be deliberate or accidental. There are
those who simply avoid any 
source of enlightenment. These persons may be lazy or
just avoid any kind of challenging 
information. This is an example of being deliberately
ignorant. On the other side of the 
coin, accidental ignorance can happen to even the
most educated and responsible person. 
Let’s face it; no one can anticipate everything that
could happen. That “bolt out of the 


--- Page 274 ---
blue” can catch anyone off guard. Ignorance may be
bliss, but it can also be fatal. In this 
case, there is no fear here only because there is no
awareness.
Awareness of that which is to be feared is an
essential survival skill and instinct. 
At this stage, the main source of fear is the
recognition of threats for which we are 
inadequately prepared. This is true fear and it comes
in two varieties. There is “chronic 
fear” of bad things that are anticipated in the
coming weeks, months, or years. Examples 
include fear of economic collapse, fear of declining
health, fear of being a crime victim, 
fear of an epidemic, or fear of a terrorist attack.
Symptoms of chronic fear include loss of 
--- Page 223 ---
150 Survival Secrets  207
sleep, inability to concentrate, anger, depression,
use of drugs or alcohol, poor decision-
making, headaches, and loss of appetite. Chronic fear
must be recognized and corrected 
before it leads to even more real and immediate
threats to your life and freedom.
Acute fear is an immediate threat to your existence
or freedom such as some smoke 
coming under your door, a gun aimed at your head,
freezing in the wilderness, or 
being on a sinking boat. Symptoms of acute fear
include nausea, shaking, loose bowels, 
psychological paralysis (freezing), and loss of fine
motor skills, tunnel vision, and fight-or-
flight reactions. The boosted adrenaline and other
fear-generated physiological reactions 
can help save you if controlled. Here you have to act
fast but also act right. Even the best 
trained have been known to panic, but training and
mental conditioning are your best 


--- Page 275 ---
defense.
Preparedness is the state where a fear has been
recognized, managed, or neutralized 
in advance. Preparedness requires that the
psychological, physical, and material 
requirements of threat response have been addressed.
The psychological aspects are 
addressed through training and mental conditioning.
Building self-confidence in 
the required abilities, having faith, developing a
personal mission, and having a plan 
are effective ways to psychologically prepare for
fear-generating situations. How one 
addresses the physical aspects of a hazard will
depend on age, sex, physical condition, and 
overall health; but regardless of these factors,
there are steps that can be taken to improve 
physical preparedness. A healthy lifestyle including
weight control, regular exercise, and 
medical checkups is always a good idea. Stocking
medications and having devices that 
compensate for any physical limitations is important.
You must ask yourself, if disaster 
happens, do I have the strength and endurance to
survive? If the answer is no, then improve 
your condition, plan ways to compensate for your
problems, or do what you can to avoid 
that situation. Material preparedness is simply
having the necessary items to avoid, 
neutralize, or survive a hazard. Survival kits and
home preparedness are addressed in 
other chapters and need not be covered here. It
should be said be said that the possession 
of survival items can compensate for some physical
limitations and impart some level of 
psychological comfort but the physical items alone
can give false confidence.
Both acute and chronic fear can be divided into three
categories. These are fear of 
the unknown, fear of pain (physical and mental), and


--- Page 276 ---
fear of one’s own inadequacies. 
While these can never be completely removed from our
minds, they can be anticipated, 
managed, and reduced.
Fear of the Unknown
In the movies, it’s always the monster you don’t see
that is the scariest. Fear of the dark, fear 
of the future, and fear of other people are all forms
of this fear. Fear of going someplace or 
doing something for the first time is one of the most
widely experienced examples of fear 
of the unknown. In its chronic manifestation, it is a
source of constant worry that wears 
us down and holds us back. In its acute form, it is
better known as fear of the unexpected. 
It is the unexpected situation that jumps up and
forces us to make fast choices without 
--- Page 224 ---
208  James C. Jones
knowing much about the situation. For example, you
wake up to the sound of the smoke 
alarm and you don’t know what caused it. Fear
initially seizes you. You may suddenly 
realize that you do not know where you are, and panic
can make you do things that 
make your situation much worse. While it is easy to
say, “Expect the unexpected,” it is by 
definition impossible to do. However, there are
things you can do to reduce the potential 
dangers of fear and panic generated by the unknown
and unexpected. While some events 
are truly unpredictable, others are unexpected
because we just don’t want to think about 
them. These can be substantially reduced by a
processes known as what-if analysis. As 
the name implies, what-if analysis is the process of
mentally considering what the result 
would be if an undesirable and hazardous situation


--- Page 277 ---
occurred and mentally dealing with 
that result in advance. What if I am bitten by a
snake out here? What if that guy approaching 
me intends to assault me? What if I can’t get home in
this blizzard? What if that smoke is from 
a big fire? You can use this process as soon as you
recognize a potential hazard. You do 
not have to wait until you smell the smoke or hear
the snakes rattle. A fear of something 
unknown can also be reduced by deliberately going at
that fear through education and 
experience. Learn more about the things you fear and
if possible gain experience with 
them in a safe manner. Planning is an especially
effective way to reduce chronic fear.
Convert the fear of an undesirable event into a plan
to cope with it. Instead of 
focusing on what if I lose my job?, focus on the
plan. If you lose your job, then you will 
cut spending. Instead of thinking, Those people are
going to kill me, think I can avoid or 
counter them if they do attack. By applying what-if
analysis to potential acute fears and 
planning for things you chronically fear, these fears
can be greatly reduced. Doing these 
things does not make you paranoid. Anticipation and
mental preparation for potential 
challenges reduce anxiety and contribute to a calmer
and more confident psyche.
Fear of Pain
Most people find pain to be unpleasant. Used here,
pain implies physical pain from 
injuries and illnesses, the more subtle pain of heat,
cold, hunger, and thirst, and the 
psychological pain we may experience from shock and
grief at losses. For example, we 
may put off going to the dentist when we know we
should, or we may delay putting a pet 
down. It is normal to avoid pain and in most cases it
is wise, but fear of pain can work 


--- Page 278 ---
against our best interests, as it does in those two
aforementioned examples.
How you react to pain is a result of your experiences
and culture. But no matter who 
you are or where you come from, be assured that the
pain will come. Knowing this, you 
can plan for the pain by treating the injury, seeking
shelter, or taking pain relievers before 
it hits you. Here again, planning and preparation can
reduce fear. Knowing first aid, 
carrying medicine, or having experienced cold and
hunger can greatly reduce the fear of 
pain. You must not let pain break your will. As long
as it hurts, you are alive, and as long 
as you are alive you have a chance to beat it. In
some cases you may even have to do things 
that cause you physical or psychological pain to
assure your survival.
--- Page 225 ---
150 Survival Secrets  209
Fear of Personal Inadequacy
Most people will acknowledge that they have some
inadequacies. We all have mental 
and physical limitations that make us fear
situations. We all fear the social implications 
of admitting that we don’t know something or that we
can’t do something. We fear 
the real hazards of being unable to shoot straight,
climb a cliff, stop severe bleeding, or 
know the way out of the woods. We are afraid of not
knowing what to do, of not doing 
the right thing, or of not being able to do the right
thing. We fear our own shame and 
the disapproval of others. This fear most often
manifests itself in a failure to act. We see 
a danger, but we don’t want to say or do anything
that would make us look silly. You 
may not take a class or try a new skill because you


--- Page 279 ---
fear failure. Those things you fear are 
often the exact things that will provide the greatest
rewards and best chances for future 
survival. There are two things you can do that will
help to deal with this fear. First, 
you must accept that inadequacies are normal and that
everyone has them. But success 
and survival depend on not letting such fears stop
you. Outright failure is better than 
not trying. The second method of fear reduction is to
define and adopt a life mission of 
continuous self-improvement in order to reduce your
inadequacies and prove to yourself 
how good you can be.
Fear is a very powerful force that can doom those who
should survive and save those 
who might otherwise perish. It allows the weak to
subdue the mighty, and the few to 
intimidate the many. It is why small forces can send
whole armies into retreat and why 
whole populations can be enslaved by a brutal few.
Being able to manage and overcome 
fear is vital to staying alive and staying free.
Courage is not being unafraid. Courage is 
being afraid and doing the right thing anyway.

115  �What causes the most deaths 
from severe injuries and 
illnesses?
Hypovolemic shock plays a major part in the death of
victims of severe external or 
internal bleeding, large-area burns, and many
communicable diseases. Loss of blood due 
to a severed artery will quickly (in seconds) drain
the body of necessary fluids. Burns 
result in sustained fluid loss. Many illnesses cause
hemorrhage, diarrhea, vomiting, and 


--- Page 280 ---
sweating while inhibiting oral fluid intake. Fluid
losses lower blood pressure and affect 
organ functions. Recognition of the potential for
shock and the signs and symptoms of 
shock are critical survival and lifesaving skills.
Shock is certain to result from serious 
bleeding, but may also result from unseen internal
bleeding and from other kinds of 
injuries. The first signs of shock are evident when
the victim becomes agitated, restless, 
and anxious. They will exhibit cold wet skin, profuse
sweating, pale skin, and extreme 
thirst, eventually progressing to dull eyes or
dilated pupils, nausea and vomiting, and 
shallow, labored breathing. If not treated
immediately, unconsciousness and then death 
will follow. If available, call 911 immediately.
Quickly stop severe bleeding if present. 
Place the victim in the prone position and elevate
the feet twelve to eighteen inches above 
the ground. Use a blanket to keep the victim warm.
But avoid exposure to excessive heat. 
Calm and reassure the victim. Splint fractures and
bandage injuries as needed. Do not 
give liquids, as this may only produce vomiting and
further complications. You may 
moisten the victim’s lips.
--- Page 227 ---
211
116  �If help is not available, what can 
I do to prevent dehydration in 
injured or ill victims?
Dehydration is one of the primary causes of death, as
it is a result of shock, heatstroke, 
radiation sickness, and many communicable diseases.
If emergency treatment is not 
immediately available and the patient is fully
conscious, oral hydration can be sustained 


--- Page 281 ---
using the following solution: Eight teaspoons of
sugar and one teaspoon of salt to one liter 
of water. Provide small four-ounce drinks every hour.
Caution: giving water or other liquids to an
unconscious, semiconscious, or seriously 
injured patient may cause them to vomit and aspirate,
eventually causing pneumonia. 
Generally these patients can be rehydrated by
intravenous methods at the ER.
--- Page 228 ---
212
117  �What kinds of weapons should a 
survivalist have in a true survival 
pack?
A true survival pack must provide supplies and
devices for all contingencies. This includes 
methods of hunting and self-protection. While the
survivalist may carry a rifle, shotgun, 
and/or handgun with the pack, there are some weapons
that should be kept in the pack 
itself. These provide backup and alternative weapons.
Compact Survival Bows and Arrows
Large, complex bows are too large for practical
survival applications, but the smaller 
take-down, compact, ultra-compact, and survival bows
offer an alternative to (not a 
replacement for) firearms. The advantages of these
weapons are:
1.       They are silent and thus will not attract
unwanted attention. This advantage 
may also permit a second shot at game or fowl
2.       They use retrievable, reusable ammunition
and you can even make arrows in an 
emergency.
3.       The skill acquired using a bow and arrow
could help you to make an improvised 
bow and arrow under extreme conditions. Practicing
with a bow and arrows 


--- Page 282 ---
costs much less than with a firearm.
4.       They are versatile and can be 
used for hunting both small 
and medium game, as well as 
fishing, line throwing, and 
other techniques
5.       Survival bows take up very 
little room and are relatively 
inexpensive.
Carrying a survival bow and some 
arrows in your pack or vehicle gives you 
some important options in a survival 
situation. For this reason, consider 
placing one in your survival kit.
Typical survival bow and four arrows. Note that the 
arrows break down for compact carry as well. This
forty-
five-pound pull bow can be assembled in less than one
minute. 
--- Page 229 ---
150 Survival Secrets  213
Survival Slingshots
While not as deadly as bow and arrow, slingshots
definitely have a place in the survival 
pack. The advantages of slingshots include:
1.       They are silent and do not attract
attention. You can usually get multiple shots 
at small game without disturbing them until you get a
hit.
2.       Practice is virtually free, and practice
makes perfect. I remember making shots 
with my slingshots that I would have a hard time
doing with a firearm.
3.       Slingshots are cheap, light, and take up
very little space in the pack.
4.       Modern survival slingshots are powerful and
can achieve velocities of 450 feet 


--- Page 283 ---
per second, and effective ranges of 
250 yards or farther.
5.       While slingshot projectiles lack the 
penetration of arrows or bullets, 
they are effective against small 
game and can be lethal to humans 
if hit in the head.
6.       Slingshots are cheap. You can 
purchase a fairly powerful 
slingshot for about twenty dollars 
or even make your own. Some 
models have optional arrows, 
sights, and ammunition stored in 
the handle.
There is really no reason not to include a 
slingshot in your survival pack. Include 
some 000 buckshot or small ball bearings, as
conveniently sized rocks are not always 
handy.
Compact Survival Rifles
A commercial version of the Air Force AR-7 survival
rifle can be purchased at most gun 
stores. They come as-is, with a rather bulky floating
stock, but weigh a mere 2.25 pounds. 
The stock takes up too much valuable room in the
pack, but can easily be replaced 
with an after-market, folding stock with handgrip.
Extra eight-round and twenty-round 
magazines are also available. Designed for survival,
this rifle is reliable and tough. With 
the stock folded it takes up very little room, adds
only a few pounds, and provides a 
reliable firearm for small game and minimal self-
defense. A few hundred rounds of 
.22-caliber, long-rifle ammunition takes up just a
few inches of space in the pack
Two extremes. The very small and cheap slingshot 
on the left is very compact but has limited power 
compared to the much larger device on the right. 
That one has greater range and power at the 


--- Page 284 ---
expense of taking up more room in your pack. Wrist-
rocket-style slingshots that permit greater power 
and accuracy are recommended for survival kits. 
--- Page 230 ---
214  James C. Jones
You can add any or all of these devices to your pack
without sacrificing much room and 
adding only a little total weight.
AR-7 with barrel removed and stock collapsed is only
fifteen inches 
long and takes up very little room in the pack. The
barrel can be 
attached in a few seconds.

118  �How can I assess and determine 
my highest risk factors?
There are three steps to improving your ability to
survive emergencies and become more 
self-reliant. The first step is to determine the true
threats to your life, liberty, and property. 
Once this is done successfully you can move on to the
second and third steps of planning 
and preparation, respectively. Hazard analysis is
critical. The key factors in determining 
what events are the most dangerous to you and your
family are probability and severity. 
These factors may be mitigated by intended or
unintended preparedness factors already 
in place. You can calculate the degree of hazard
posed by a specified event, based on how 
likely it is to happen to you, plus how much harm it
will do to you, minus how much 
protection and preparedness you already have. For
example, long-term loss of utilities 
(water, heat, electricity) may be likely and have


--- Page 285 ---
dire effects but you may have a fireplace, 
swimming pool, a generator, or other tools that would
greatly reduce this hazard. Of 
course, this is just a guiding concept, not a rigid
mathematical formula. The table below 
illustrates this method by assigning a numerical
value of 1 (unlikely) to 5 (certain), as the 
probability and severity increases. The hazards you
would rate at 9 or 10 would require 
the highest priority in your preparedness and
planning program. Those with a rating of 7 
or 8 will need attention but you may be able to put
off actions to address hazards rated at 
6 or below. Keep in mind that as you plan and prepare
for the high-priority hazards you 
will probably reduce the probability and severity of
the other similar hazards.

Using the method above you can produce your own
survival preparedness matrix, 
as illustrated below. We list the potential hazards
along the left side and then assign 
a probability and a severity value. Next we subtract
a factor for any mitigating risk 
reduction or preparedness actions already in place.
For example: cleaning out the attic 
and garage could reduce the home fire probability,
two incomes can reduce the severity of 
job loss, or a shelter could reduce the effects of a
tornado. The chart above illustrates this 
method, but the reader may choose to simply assign
priorities based on potential effects 
and probabilities with this concept in mind.
Hazard:

harmful to your 
life, liberty and 
property
Probability: 
How likely 
is it this will 
happen to or 
affect you?
Severity:
How severe 
are the 
consequences 
to you?

In the above example assume that smoke alarms, fire
extinguishers, and good 
housekeeping have reduced the probability of a house
fire; that security systems and 
weapons have reduced the crime and riot factors; and
that pumps and sandbags are ready 
for a flood. Of course your list of hazards will be
different than the ones used in the 


--- Page 290 ---
example above. Some factors that will create your
personal hazards include.
--- Page 233 ---
150 Survival Secrets  217
Your health and physical condition: 
Chronic ailments, smoking, weight, etc. 
can drastically affect your survival options.
Your job and hobbies: Working in 
high-risk jobs or partaking in dangerous 
pastimes can create hazards if you do not 
follow procedures and wear necessary 
protection.
Your financial situation: Often 
overlooked. You can’t buy emergency 
supplies without funds.
Your travel means and routes: More 
diving through dangerous urban areas or 
backcountry roads increases risk. 
Your lifestyle and habits: Hanging 
around bars and clubs, risky associations, 
time in crowds where diseases spread, etc.
Your selection of friends and associates: 
If your associates are involved in risky 
activities, it’s time to get away from them.
Your family: Your family’s strength and 
support can greatly increase everyone’s 
chances to survive and thrive in hard 
times. Weak and untrustworthy members 
can bring everyone to ruin.
Your community: Is your community 
divided and/or controlled by gangs and 
drugs? Are your neighbors unwilling to be 
responsible and prepared? 
Your knowledge: Your general education 
will increase your financial strength so 
you can build your survival capacity. Your 
survival skills broaden your options and 
self-confidence.


--- Page 291 ---
Your climate: Obviously the weather in 
your area can affect your survival chances 
greatly but every area has its own set of 
hazards. There are no safe areas.
Your home: Here many people die of 
fires, carbon monoxide, falls and other 
totally preventable causes. A safe and 
secure home should be your first priority.
Your location: Is your location prone to 
earthquakes or floods? Are you downwind 
of chemical plants? Would your area 
attract looters?
You have at least some control of most of the above
factors. You can change your 
habits, increase your knowledge, move to another
location, and change your friends. 
You definitely should remove fire hazards from your
home and install smoke and carbon 
monoxide detectors. It is impossible to find a
totally safe area, a completely safe job, or 
a risk-free lifestyle. You can, and should, however,
consider the risks to your life, health, 
liberty, and property versus the benefits. For
example: a good-paying job as a police 
officer may be worth the benefits if you determine to
follow all risk-reduction procedures. 
Smoking or letting combustibles accumulate in your
basement are risks with no benefits 
at all. Assuming that you have recognized your main
risks and taken steps to avoid or 
reduce them where practical, you now have to prepare
to survive and thrive through risk-
laden challenges.
--- Page 234 ---
218  James C. Jones
Survival Planning
Survival planning means thinking through the
chronology of the hazard event and 


--- Page 292 ---
having an effective action ready to minimize the
event’s impact on your safety, liberty, 
and property. Reading the stories of those who have
survived similar situations can be 
very helpful. Doing a walk-through or what-if
analysis of the potential event can also be 
helpful. Your plan should assume that nothing is
“normal”: phones will not work, roads 
will be closed, family members will not be home, etc.
etc. The plans should be simple 
and easy for everyone to understand. You might have a
house fire escape plan, a crime 
intruder plan, a power outage plan, and a long-term
survival plan.
Survival Preparedness
Survival Preparedness means gathering the equipment
and acquiring the skills needed 
to survive the anticipated emergency. Depending on
the anticipated hazard, this could 
mean a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, or it
could mean serious survival training and 
a fully stocked shelter.
If the key to effective medical action is diagnosis,
then the key to an effective plan 
to survive and thrive in today’s world of hazards is
analysis. Having the right stuff when 
you need it and where you need it depends on accurate
analysis of your hazards and 
vulnerabilities.

119  �How can I survive a wildfire or 
forest fire?
Wildfires are becoming more and more common
throughout the United States as a 
result of droughts and longer dry seasons. In past
decades, most destructive wildfires 
occurred in the West and Southwest during the late


--- Page 293 ---
summer and early autumn months. 
Additionally, in recent years the development and
population of heavily forested regions 
have grown dramatically. We now have hundreds of
thousands of people inhabiting dry 
forests and grasslands. Now climate shifts have
created massive fuel shortages, while 
the presence of more people has increased the sources
of ignition and the danger to 
life and property. Climate shifts have also resulted
in higher winds and more frequent 
lightning, resulting in fast-developing firestorms
that can overrun communities before 
effective warnings and evacuations can be initiated.
Prolonged droughts have resulted in 
all-year fire seasons throughout the western states.
Even more troubling, grass fires and 
forest fires have recently devastated southern and
eastern regions that were previously 
considered immune to these hazards.
Since it is not possible for the individual to
prevent a wildfire that originates outside 
of their property, the only choice is to prevent the
fire from reaching you and your home. 
If a wildfire has fuel and your home is on its path,
then there is little chance of preventing 
ignition of the structure: at that point your only
option is to evacuate.
Creating a Defensive Space
The only effective way to prevent a wildfire from
reaching your home is to remove the 
fuel path and create a defensive space where the fire
has nothing to burn. In the case of 
grasslands, dry grass and shrubs must be cut and
removed before the dry season arrives. 
In the case of forests, you may need to cut down and
remove trees from thirty to as far 
as two hundred feet away, depending on the slope. If
your home is located on a slope 
you will need to clear brush and trees much farther


--- Page 294 ---
on the downhill side. Unless you 
own the land for five hundred or more feet in all
directions from your home, it will be 
necessary to get your neighbors to clear their
defensive spaces as well. A defensive space 
will not guarantee that embers will not come down on
your roof. During a wildfire all 
fire departments will be fully employed and your
power may go out as well. Even if you 
have municipal water, the pressure may be too low to
help put out embers and sparks. A 
pool or pond connected to a gasoline- or battery-
powered pump should establish an inner 
defense. Backpack water-pump sprayers and shovels may
also be helpful in extinguishing 
embers and hot-spot fires. The following charts and
tables will be helpful in creating an 
effective defensive space.
--- Page 236 ---
220  James C. Jones
The Three Rs of Creating Defensive Space
REMOVAL
Completely remove the entire plant. Cut down trees,
dig up 
shrubs, and plow under grasses. 
REDUCTION
Thorough pruning of trees and bushes, regular mowing
of grass, 
and removal of all cut wood and mowed grass.
REPLACEMENT
Substitute less-flammable vegetation such as flowers
or low 
growing vegetables

Recommended Practice for Types of Dead Vegetation

Recommended Practice
Standing dead trees
Remove these within the defensive space.
Down dead trees
Remove if recently fallen, If embedded in 
the ground, cut off exposed branches.
Dead shrubbery
Remove these within the defensive space
Dried grass and wildflowers, etc.
Once they are dried out, cut down and 
remove from defensive space.
Dead needles, leaves and branches, and 
twigs on the ground


--- Page 296 ---
Clear all leaves, branches, and twigs. 
If pine needles are dry, remove until 
you reach damp decaying layer. Do not 
remove decomposing material.
Firewood and other combustible debris
Keep firewood, grass clippings, and 
combustible debris at least thirty feet 
uphill from the house.
Unused and decaying structures 
Old sheds, barns, and other structures 
within the defensible space offer a bridge 
for the fire. These must be removed.
Ladder fuels can elevate a small 
grass fire into a crown fire if not 
removed. A bush below a small tree that 
is then next to a tall tree can escalate 
the danger significantly. Remove 
shrubs and bushes from below trees to 
at least three times the distance from 
the lowest tree branch to the ground.
Evacuation
Regardless of how well you have 
established your defensive space and 
fire-suppression systems, a wildfire 
may overwhelm you. You must always 
have an evacuation plan and not hesitate to evacuate.
Wildfires (any fires) move incredibly 
fast and in unpredictable ways. If you can see the
flames and smell the smoke, that fire 
could be on you within the hour or less. A brush fire
with eight-foot-high flames will 
travel at about five miles per hour without a wind
and consume three thousand acres 
per hour. A shrub and brush fire with flames
averaging ten to twenty feet will move at 
Dry grass and dead trees provide an easy path to the 
home in the background for fire.
--- Page 238 ---


--- Page 297 ---
222  James C. Jones
six to eight miles per hour, consuming up to five
thousand acres per hour. High crown 
fires with flames one hundred feet or higher can race
through forests and jump roads 
and rivers at up to three-hundred yards per minute.
If ash begins to fall in your location, 
the fire may be only minutes behind. Delaying is not
an option. Don’t be complacent or 
procrastinate!
Have a wildfire escape plan ahead of time. If
possible move children, pets, elderly 
people, and valuables to a safe location outside the
fire zone as soon as wildfire is detected 
in the area and before evacuation is mandatory.
Pets and children pose special problems for
evacuation. Plan on how you are going 
to get them to safety quickly as a fire roars toward
your home. Determine what you are 
going to take if you need to evacuate and have those
items in packs, bins, or loaded in your 
vehicle well in advance. Fire-resistant safes are
rated to protect the contents for a limited 
time and temperature. Read the labels before you buy
one. You can have ammunition 
cans in holes ready to fill and cover if needed. Have
a wildfire survival kit (see below) for 
every family member.
Surviving a Wildfire
A wildfire may start so close to you or move so fast
that you may be overtaken at home 
or on the road. If you can see flames and smell smoke
you need to move quickly away 
from that direction. It is always best to move upwind
and downhill from the fire. If you 
can hear crackling and feel heat it may be too late
to escape. You cannot outrun a fire 
at this point. Look for lakes or ponds to submerge in
or seek ditches, bridges, culverts, 
caves and overhangs that may offer some protection.


--- Page 298 ---
If nothing else is available, find a 
large green grassy area or low spot and lie down.
Even digging a small indentation in the 
soil will help. Remove all synthetic clothing that
may melt to your skin. Cover your head 
and face with wet non-synthetic cloth to avoid
breathing in hot air and soot. If you have 
enough water, moisten your clothing. Lie flat and the
fire may pass over you. Stay calm 
and wait until the fire passes. Remember that the
ground may be still be hot and embers 
may be hot enough to ignite your clothing and burn
your skin. Move carefully downhill 
and upwind of the fire through burned-out areas to
reach safety.
Wildfire Survival Kits
Wildfire survival kits are not like FEMA evacuation
packs or bugout bags. If you survive 
and escape the fire, you will reach help fairly
quickly. You don’t need food and a lot of 
gear for prolonged survival. Your equipment needs to
be focused totally on surviving and 
escaping the fire.
•       
You should have at least six N95 dust/mist
respirators to keep soot, smoke, and 
heated air out of your lungs.
•       
You need to have a pair of good safety googles to
protect your eyes from sparks 
and debris.
--- Page 239 ---
150 Survival Secrets  223
•       
You need to have a good pair of long-sleeved work
gloves to move hot embers 
and debris.
•       


--- Page 299 ---
Have a wide-brimmed “boonie” hat to keep sparks and
embers off your head 
and neck.
•       
A powerful flashlight can penetrate smoke and help
rescuers find you.
•       
One or two quarts of water to wet clothing and douse
sparks.
•       
A good camp shovel may come in handy if you have to
dig in or clear a path.
•       
You will need plenty of water to wet down your
clothing, hat, and masks, and 
put out sparks on your clothing and skin.
•       
If you feel you are likely to be trapped and have to
dig in and let the fire pass 
over you, you may want to invest in a fire blanket.
These are flame-resistant 
and heat-resistant covers that you can put over
yourself as you lie flat in a low, 
clear area or a trench you have dug. You can find
these at FireSafetySource.
com. One of these weighs just five pounds, comes in a
pouch, and costs less 
than one hundred dollars.
•       
Of course you will want to have copies of all of your
identification, insurance, 
medical, and financial documents.
In this case, a lot of food and additional survival
gear is just going to slow you down.
Wildfire Safety Tips
•       
If you see a wildfire and have not heard a warning or
evacuation order, call 
911. Do not assume that it has been called in.
•       


--- Page 300 ---
Be sure you are included in any email or call alert
system in your town or 
county.
•       
If you do get an order to evacuate, do it
immediately, but let others know 
where you are going and then contact them when you
have safely arrived.
•       
Keep your vehicle fully fueled and in good condition.
Have your emergency 
supplies and a change of clothes in the vehicle.
•       
After a wildfire, only return when authorities say
that it is safe to do so.
•       
After a fire has passed, maintain a fire watch and
inspect for smoke, sparks, 
and embers throughout the house, attic, and roof.
•       
Discard any food that has been exposed to heat and
smoke.
•       
Be sure to photograph all damages for insurance
purposes before cleaning up 
and removing debris.
•       
If you or anyone with you is burned, cool the burn
with cool water and cover 
with a sterile bandage. Go to an emergency room or
aid station for treatment.
•       
If you inhale smoke and/or hot air, you may suffer
respiratory disorders later. 
Go to a hospital and report this exposure.

120  �Should a survivalist be good  


--- Page 301 ---
at identifying and using edible 
wild plants?
Any survival skill is good to have, but for most
situations, wild edible plants will not be 
a significant food source. One should also be aware
that going from a normal diet to 
one based in edible wild plants can cause significant
intestinal distress. At best you may 
be able to supplement your rations with a few wild
edibles. Most urban and suburban 
survivalists are unlikely to be lost in the forests
and dependent on foraging. Some easily 
identifiable edibles—dandelions, plantains, and
purslane are common even in the city 
lots. Wild raspberries and strawberries are easily
identifiable. There are books and even 
cards that can help identify edible and poisonous
plants. Since poisoning is the last thing 
you need in a survival situation, it is best to avoid
trying to eat any wild plants. In the 
gravest extreme when food supplies are exhausted and
rescue or escape is improbable, you 
can use the following method to determine if a plant
is edible.
1.       Smell the plant to detect strong or acidic
odors. Obviously if it smells 
unappetizing, it probably will not be suitable.
2.       Break the plant into its parts (root, stem,
leaf, and flower) and test each part 
separately. Some plants have highly poisonous parts
while other parts are quite 
edible. If part of a plant proves to be edible that
does not imply that it is safe to 
eat other parts. Each part that you plan to eat must
be tested individually.
3.       Place the plant part you will be orally
testing on the inside of your elbow or 
wrist for about fifteen minutes. If a rash or
irritation develops, the plant should 
be rejected as a food source. If no irritation


--- Page 302 ---
develops, then continue.
4.       Consume nothing but clean, safe water for
eight hours prior to oral testing.
5.       Touch the plant part to your mouth and see
if there is a burning sensation.
6.       If after fifteen minutes there is no
reaction to your lips, place the plant part on 
your tongue for fifteen minutes.
7.      
If no adverse reaction, chew thoroughly and hold in
you mouth, but do not 
swallow.
8.       If there is still no burning or irritation
after fifteen minutes, swallow the food.
9.       Wait eight hours. If no ill effects, prepare
about one-half cup and consume that. 
If there are no ill effects after eight more hours,
you can include this plant in 
your diet.
This is a time-consuming test to establish each
edible plant, but a handy thing to know 
for a survivalist who anticipates extended wilderness
isolation.
--- Page 241 ---
225
121  �Should a survivalist be skilled at 
knife fighting?
While survivalists usually carry some kind of knife 
whenever possible and are bound to include a serious 
blade in their survival kits and bags, combat knives
are 
rarely considered. Of course any knife can be used as
a 
weapon, but survival knives are designed as a tool
first 
and weapon second. The most probable scenarios for 
a survivalist are (1) being confronted by an unarmed 
assailant, in which case a knife of any type settles


--- Page 303 ---
the 
issue; or (2) being confronted by a knife-wielding
assailant 
when the survivalist then uses a firearm to deal with
the 
threat. The old adage “never bring a knife to a gun
fight” 
certainly applies here. Knife fighting is best
avoided. Even 
the best knife fighters usually get cut. Often there
are no 
winners, as both combatants may be seriously injured
or 
one or both bleed to death. Use a knife against a
knife only if you have no better weapon 
and cannot retreat or escape the attack. The only
rule in a knife fight is to survive. If such 
a confrontation is unavoidable, here are a few tips.
•       
An assailant will often focus on your blade, leaving
himself open to disabling 
kicks and strikes.
•       
If you can access anything to use as a shield, do so.
•       
Wrap a coat or other material around your arm to
absorb and deflect stabs.
•       
Throw things to distract the knife-wielding
assailment. Even throwing small 
objects or liquids will force reflexive distraction.
•       
Bright light, dirt, sand, and aerosol sprays can be
used to blind the assailment.
•       
An amateur knife fighter may thrust or slash wildly,
offering a chance to move 
in and grab their knife arm, twisting it and smashing
the back elbow joint to 
dislocate it, while smashing your forearm and elbow


--- Page 304 ---
against their face and your 
knee to their groin.
•       
In the absence of a firearm, the best defense is to
use both of your feet to run 
like hell if you can.
If you elect to carry a fighting knife you can choose
the Sykes-Fairbairn two-sided stiletto 
that was favored by World War II commandos or the
curved karambit used in Far Eastern 
combat principles. Such combat knives are not
effective for most other survival uses.
A typical commando-style knife.

226
122  �Should survivalists use and 
depend on advanced technology?
Survivalists should make maximum use of currently
operating technologies to gather 
information and build networks, but should not
establish such systems as permanent or 
essential systems. Here are some guidelines and
cautions for using modern technology as 
survival tools.
•       
Non-networked, freestanding self-reliance
technologies such as solar power, 
wind power, and hydroponics should be embraced and
combined with older 
technology to build sustainable self-reliance
systems, but dependence on 
interconnected, internet-dependent, or externally
controlled systems should be 
avoided.
•       
Technologies that permit other entities to monitor
your communications, 
purchases, habits, movements, and even listen to your


--- Page 305 ---
conversations are 
counter to basic survival philosophy and practices.
•       
Dependency on or addiction to cell phones, social
media, and artificial 
intelligence devices effectively negate any pretense
of survival capability.
•       
Use good internet security. Avoid opening
unidentified emails. Avoid online 
banking, change passwords frequently, do not put
information on social 
media, and do not respond to online surveys. Buy at
stores with cash when 
possible to avoid having your purchases and habits
tracked and your banking 
information available to the world.
•       
Real, active training and group building is the only
reliable way to survive and 
remain independent in the future.
•       
Useful survival information may be gathered from the
internet, but depending 
on that source in an emergency is foolish. Hard
copies are still the only reliable 
storage method.
Regard technology as a tool to be used, but not
depended upon. Use the tools, but do not 
let the tools use you.
--- Page 243 ---
227
123  �Should survivalists organize or 
join survival groups and prepper 
clubs, or should they remain 
isolated?
Many survivalists prefer to keep their concerns and
preparedness efforts confidential. 


--- Page 306 ---
The bad press given to survivalists makes it
difficult for many to admit to being a 
survivalist or to discuss survival-related subjects
with others. The modern survivalist may 
be surprised to find how many closet survivalists are
among his or her neighbors and 
associates. Survivalists are no longer part of a
small subculture. We are an important part 
of a responsible and important movement.
Beyond surviving immediate, short-term future
emergencies, the survivalist is going 
to need to work with others for sustained survival
and recovery. No one person can stay 
alert and on guard twenty-four hours a day; no one
person can provide medical aid for 
him- or herself and others simultaneously; no one
person can have the skills, knowledge, 
and physical capacity to do everything needed in any
sustained disaster. You will need a 
prepared family, team, organization, community, or
network. A group may adopt some 
or all of these survival-related missions.

124  �What kinds of missions can a 
survival group have to retain a 
positive focus?
Most groups of any kind fail without a clearly
established mission. The following four 
suggested mission statements for a survival group
provide a guide to help you and your 
group or family create a coherent mission statement.
Having this sorted out creates a 
path to security and independence for the group and
its members and also establishes 
responsible goals for community support.
Member Emergency and Preparedness Support
Support members and their families in achieving the


--- Page 307 ---
capability to survive and recover 
from common short-term natural and man-made disasters
without the support or 
interference of outside agencies. To this end,
provide training, information, equipment, 
and supplies in affordable and practical programs.
Member Liberation through Self-Reliance
Support members and their families in achieving
increased self-reliance and independence 
from centralized or failing sources of essential
needs such as food, water, energy, protection, 
and medical aid. Work to create a semi-independent
lifestyle and economic network that 
reduces risks, regulation, taxes, and waste, while
improving life security and quality.
Strength through Networking and Mutual Support
Recruit and develop new members, while developing
networks with other organizations 
with compatible and like-minded goals. These
networked communities of self-reliance 
will be able to exchange instructors, share
resources, combine operations and purchases, 
and engage in trade and barter for critical supplies
and skills in an emergency.
Community Service and Education
Advocate and educate for preparedness and self-
reliance through community-based 
programs including educational seminars, speakers,
and fairs. Support government and 
private community preparedness and emergency response
programs wherever practical.
Additionally, to build a successful survival group,
stay focused on your mission and 
set goals and schedules based on that mission.
Broaden your leadership base to include as 
many others as possible. Other helpful tasks include:

--- Page 308 ---
•       
Welcome new members and give them something to be
involved in. Attrition 
is inevitable. People move away, change jobs, or
become ill. If you are not 
constantly bringing in new members your group will
evaporate over time.
•       
Constant and constructive activities are essential.
These include meetings, field 
trips, training, community outreach, and classes.
Review of plans, show-and-
tell, and disaster drills can all be ways to sustain
interest. Don’t overlook non-
survival-related activities such as picnics or
holiday parties.
•       
Focus on the quality and compatibility of your group,
not the size. Three 
or four devoted and loyal members is better than
dozens of inactive and 
unreliable ones. A group much larger than fifty
persons probably needs to 
divide and network.
•       
Setting limited goals can leave your group dead. You
are never ready enough or 
self-reliant enough. There can be no point at which
you are done preparing.
--- Page 246 ---
230
125  �What are the dos and don’ts 
for a new or existing survival 
organization?
The great majority of so-called prepper or survival
groups wither or self-destruct within 
three to four years. In most cases the cause is
related to what they did wrong, or that they 


--- Page 309 ---
failed to do that needed to be done.
Here are some of the things that long-standing,
dynamic survival groups regularly do.
•       
Have an established and positive mission.
•       
Have a vision of where you want to be one, five, or
ten years into the future, 
regardless of events and conditions.
•       
Develop a solid core group of leaders and
instructors.
•       
Be ready to work with other like-minded organizations
such as fraternal, 
business, religious, or community groups. In fact, a
survival group or 
emergency preparedness group can form as a subgroup
or committee within 
such existing organizations. Military families do
this now.
•       
Be good neighbors. Get out there when people need
help. Support local charity 
and aid events. Share your knowledge and skills. Even
sponsor preparedness or 
outdoor survival class and fairs.
Here are some of the major errors that have caused
survival groups to dissolve.
•       
Permitting mission creep or diversion. Make sure to
stay on point. Getting 
involved in political activities, religious issues,
or other activities outside of 
survival and self-reliance usually leads to internal
problems, misunderstanding, 
and disillusionment. You can support any and all
kinds of groups as their 
survival consultants and supporters, but not let them
divert time and resources 


--- Page 310 ---
from your mission.
•       
Getting hung up on the “apocalypse of the month.”
Getting ready for a 
certain doomsday event leads to a dead end when it
fails to happen. True 
survivalism is about getting ready for anything and
achieving increasing levels 
of preparedness and self-reliance no matter what
happens or when.
•       
Becoming internalized and paranoid. Fifty percent of
your activities should 
be concerned with gathering more members and
establishing your level of 
responsibility. The other 50 percent should be
internal activities for the benefit 
and security of members. This balance assures
sustainable growth
--- Page 247 ---
150 Survival Secrets  231
•       
Compromising on membership. No matter what skills or
resources they may 
offer, you must reject and avoid association with
those with violent, criminal, 
or extremist views and ideas.
•       
Getting discouraged. You will probably have failed
activities. You may not get 
the support you need. Success and the opportunities
to succeed only come to 
those who are out there getting involved and trying.
That may be the most 
important survival attribute of a leader.
Note: No one ever achieved anything from inside a
bunker. Those who are underground 
are dead or at least irrelevant. That’s not much of a


--- Page 311 ---
survival mission.
--- Page 248 ---
232
126  �What kinds of military-style 
training and tactics would be of 
value in survival situations?
While a survivalist is not a soldier and a survival
group is not a military or paramilitary 
unit, there are several tactical skills and
capabilities that survivalists should learn and 
practice. In today’s world, civilians are often the
main target of terrorists, gangs, and 
foreign or domestic paramilitary forces. Any large-
scale collapse and civil disorder would 
result in situations where combat capabilities and
military tactics would be essential for 
survival. It is important to understand that for
military organizations the objective of 
taking a hill, building, or town takes priority over
personal or group survival; but for 
a survival family or group, survival is the primary
objective. In most cases, the tactics 
explained in this chapter should be used defensively
or to facilitate safety and security. 
Exceptions where aggressive tactics might be applied
would be for rescue situations.
The individual survivalist who has not served in the
military will have more difficulty 
dealing with combat situations. Most military tactics
assume that the participants are 
healthy, relatively young, and well trained. Most
survivalist families will have mixed 
capabilities and cannot afford any casualties. For
these reasons, survivalists should avoid 
military-like combat situations whenever possible.
However, when plunged into a life-or-
death scenario, any level of training and tactical
capability will confer a great advantage. 


--- Page 312 ---
Most assaults, ambushes, and raids will be initiated
by untrained gangs and groups that 
will be dealt with effectively by the application of
basic military movements. Even if 
you are assaulted by some kind of organized
paramilitary group, your knowledge and 
training will confer a greater chance for survival
and escape. While it is not practical to 
fully explain all of the necessary techniques and
tactics in a few pages, what follows are 
the basic principles. The survivalist should study
military texts and take advantage of any 
opportunities to experience practical training.
Weapons-Use Skills
Tactical usage of firearms goes well beyond the basic
self-defense use of a handgun that is 
necessary for normal civilian crime-resistance
applications. The survivalist who anticipates 
a potential military-like combat situation must
become proficient in the use of high-
capacity tactical rifles. Most current tactical
rifles are based on either the US Military 
AR-15 or Russian Kalashnikov AK-47 designs. These are
classified as assault rifles, but 
are highly effective in self-defense and survival, as
well as hunting for game. The AR-15s 
and similar designs are reliable and accurate, but
require more care than AKs. AK-47s 
are not as accurate as the AR-15s, but are extremely
reliable and can function without 
maintenance and cleaning for extended periods. The
ARs use 5.56mm ammunition that is 
--- Page 249 ---
150 Survival Secrets  233
plentiful and therefore may be available 
in survival conditions. The AK-47s 
uses 7.62 mm Russian ammunition 
that is available during normal times, 


--- Page 313 ---
but might become scarce in the future. 
In any case, the survivalist should have 
no fewer than two thousand rounds 
of ammunition and six spare thirty-
round magazines on hand along with 
spare parts and cleaning kits. If you 
anticipate combat in urban areas or 
within buildings, short carbine or 
folding-stock versions may be worth 
consideration. Reflex sights might also 
be a useful addition. Although combat 
rifles have an effective range of 400 
meters or farther, the defensive use 
will probably be at much closer ranges. 
The survivalist should be proficient 
at hitting man-sized targets at about 
100 yards before developing longer-
range capabilities. If possible, fire at 
least 200 rounds from your primary 
survival rifle quarterly. Fire more often 
if practical. Then practice disassembly 
and cleaning. You should also practice 
rapid magazine changes, as well as 
firing from kneeling, standing, and 
prone positions and from behind cover. 
These options are usually available at 
combat ranges and training facilities.
All survivalists should understand the difference
between cover and concealment. 
Concealment simply means that you are in a place
where the enemy cannot see you. 
This may prevent your being shot at or at least
reduce your chances of being hit, but it 
will not stop a bullet if the enemy does decide to
fire in that direction. Use cover that is 
a truly bulletproof or at least bullet-resistant
location, such as behind the engine block 
of a vehicle, a brick wall, a large tree, or a
trench. Armor-piercing rifle ammunition can 
penetrate auto bodies, several inches of hardwood,


--- Page 314 ---
cement blocks, and appliances. Cover 
only lasts until the enemy maneuvers around it, so it
is a temporary refuge to buy time 
for escape or counteraction.
Route selection while on the move is a critical
military skill. Under hostile conditions, 
you cannot just walk down the road and expect to
survive. The obvious and easy path

is usually going to lead you to destruction. Use your
binoculars to view your route in 
advance. Consider where you might be ambushed or
trapped. If you cannot avoid these 
places, have a plan to scout them and clear them
rather than just walk into them. The 
routes for daytime movement and nighttime movement
are usually different. In the 
daytime you do not want to be out in the open or
silhouetted for an enemy hiding in the 
woods or rocks. You will want to stick to those areas
where you are best concealed and 
can find cover immediately. Stumbling at night
through heavy foliage and rough terrain 
may be more risky than using flat terrain, but you
must avoid being silhouetted. Stay 
low. Use low ground and stay quiet. Moving down
gravel roads is particularly risky at 
night, as the crunch of feet is easily heard. Avoid


--- Page 315 ---
moving on any kind of road. Stick to the 
shoulders, where movement is better concealed and
cover is closer at hand.
A survivalist should be able to move safely under
fire. Shuffling along, marching or 
casual walking are not good enough under threat
conditions. 
Movement under combat conditions is always risky. The
advantage always lies with 
the potential ambusher or sniper. If possible, avoid
moving through any potentially 
hostile area. Stay put or take a longer and safer
route if possible. If you must move about, 
do so in a combat-ready condition.
Whether you are moving in daylight or at night,
discipline is essential. Talking in 
normal tones is prohibited, and whispering should
only used for essential communications. 
Everyone’s gear must be secured so it does not
squeak, rattle, or clang. Have everyone 
jump up and down before starting out to detect and
secure any noise sources. Any shiny 
or glowing objects should also be covered. If extreme
stealth is needed, rags or heavy 
socks can be placed over shoes. Only muted or
camouflage colors can be worn. This 
includes shoes and socks. White flashlights should
never be used at night. Red-lensed 
flashlights, preferably covered under ponchos or
coats, can be used to consult maps if 
absolutely necessary. Needless to say, cell phones
are strictly prohibited.
Bunching up and lack of attention are invitations to
assault. Even if there are just two 
or three people, they must maintain a distance from
each other in a staggered formation, 
so that they cannot be taken or shot all together.
The distance depends on the terrain and 
the visibility. At minimum, each member should
maintain a distance of at least four to six 


--- Page 316 ---
feet from others in all directions. This distance can
be a bit farther in open terrain, but 
may need to be closer on dark nights. Members should
always be in position to support 
and protect each other in a staged formation that
permits firing in multiple directions 
without endangering fellow members.
In every group, one person must stop, squat, slowly
turn around, and listen every few 
minutes. A group must have clearly assigned
directions of responsibility such as front 
and right flank, left flank and rear, etc., to assure
360-degree coverage. Larger groups 
should send out a point man and have a designated
rear guard. Additionally, a flank 
security person or team may be needed in some kinds
of terrain. The point man’s task 
is extremely fatiguing as it requires constant
vigilance in all directions. This task should 
be rotated frequently. Normally, the point man should
be just in view of the lead person 
in the group. The rear guard usually stays closer to
the group, but must stop periodically 
--- Page 251 ---
150 Survival Secrets  235
and turn around to watch for enemies. The people at
the rear of the group should always 
be checking to be sure the rear guard is still there
and safe. In a single-file column, every 
other person should keep guard on the alternating
sides, with the front person watching 
ahead and the rear person regularly checking behind.
In a double column, the right row 
covers the right side and the left row covers the
left side. Frequent rest stops are necessary, 
but are not a time for conversation or bunching up.
Select a well-concealed spot off roads 
and paths for these stops. Put out 360-degree


--- Page 317 ---
security. If a small group stops, they should 
all face outward while resting.
Crossing Lanes
Crossing roads, railroad tracks, and other open lanes
is particularly hazardous under 
hostile conditions. Anyone looking down that lane has
a clear field of vision and fire. 
Cross at a narrow point or a sharp bend where your
action is least visible.
There are two schools of thought about crossing. You
can send one scout across to 
secure the opposite side and in advance. This may
only alert the enemy that more are 
coming. The other tactic is to all rush across at
once before the enemy can react. Both 
methods have advantages and risks. You do not want to
wander across or loiter. If you 
know the crossing will be opposed and cannot find
another route, you can use fire and 
maneuver by having half the group fire to pin down
the enemy, while the other crosses and 
then fires to cover the second group’s crossing; this
is an exercise a survival group should 
practice. If you have smoke bombs, these can be of
great help in such crossings.
Diversion and Misdirection
Diversions and misdirection are key military skills.
Smoke or fireworks can be used to 
draw attention away from you while you escape or
maneuver. A false campsite can attract 
looters and raiders while your real site remains
hidden. Dummy defenses and bunkers 
can draw fire away from your true location. False
trails can be laid away from your true 
route.
Counter-Ambush Techniques
The ambush is the most deadly situation a group can
find itself in. The best way to avoid 
being a victim is to avoid movement, especially at
night. The advantage always lies with 


--- Page 318 ---
the ambusher who chooses the place and time and
remains hidden.
Since it is most likely that survivalists will not be
encountering well-trained and 
heavily equipped ambushers, basic ambush avoidance
and counter ambush methods 
should be effective.
An ambush may simply be a group of shooters hiding
along the side of the road or 
in buildings where they have good concealment. A more
sophisticated ambush would 
involve a roadblock or debris to stop the group in
the kill zone. Sharp turns in a road or 
down a path can permit ambushers to fire down the
length of your group as well as from 
--- Page 252 ---
236  James C. Jones
a flank. These are the locations that a survivalist
on the move must be especially aware of. 
The point man should be constantly alert for signs of
activity, noises, and shadows, and 
signal the group to halt if anything looks or feels
suspicious. Since the group may already 
be in or near a kill zone, it may need to back out
and consider ways to avoid or eliminate 
the threat. There are several counter-ambush tactics
that are effective depending on the 
situation. The survival group should be well trained
in each counter-ambush drill.
If the group has not entered the kill zone, the best
action is to back out while 
maintaining good order, and fire if necessary. You
can then opt to go around the ambush, 
or flank them and flush them out of the position.
If the group is well into a kill zone and under fire,
you may be able to fire on the 
ambushing location while quickly running out of the
danger zone or crawling to safety.


--- Page 319 ---
If quick escape is not an option, then your only
other choice is to charge the ambush site 
with all the firepower you can bring in hope of
overrunning or dispersing the ambushers. 
The one thing you do not want to do is remain in the
kill zone and engage in a firefight. The 
leader must call the counter ambush and the team must
execute it immediately. Regardless 
of training, being caught in an ambush almost always
results in casualties. If the ambushers 
are well trained and/or numerically superior, you may
expect very serious losses.
When any kind of counter-ambush drill is executed,
your group is going to be 
dispersed. This is particularly true in heavy forests
and at night. Having preestablished 
rally points and passwords will be critical in
reestablishing the group and avoiding 
additional losses.
Basic Military Maneuvers
Fire and maneuver is the most basic military drill
and should be understood by any 
group that anticipates a combat situation. The
British call this tactic “bonding over 
watch.” Simply put, one person or team shoots at the
enemy while the other moves to 
a better position. In an offensive situation, the
fire team pins the enemy with fire while 
the maneuver team moves closer. Then they change
tasks so that the maneuver team 
becomes the fire team, while the fire team maneuvers
even closer until the objective 
is taken or flanked. In withdrawal, the same
alternating persons or teams execute the 
maneuver until they are out of range or into a safe
position. While fire and maneuver 
can be used to facilitate an assault or withdrawal,
flanking to the right or left should 
always be preferred if possible. Frontal assault or a
running retreat is generally costly and 


--- Page 320 ---
often disastrous. Survivalists that truly anticipate
combat situation should be trained in 
execution of fire and maneuver.
Field fortifications are a necessary skill for
survival. Failure to dig in has doomed 
many complacent units in the past. Trenches,
foxholes, and improvised bunkers provide 
the defender with a great advantage against even a
superior force. When time is short or 
the ground is hard (rocky or frozen) scraping even a
shallow spot with some dirt, rocks, 
and debris in front is far better than lying in the
open. A pile of dirt in front of a trench 
or foxhole may give away your location, so try to
camouflage them with leaves and debris. 
--- Page 253 ---
150 Survival Secrets  237
In general, foxholes should hold no more than two
people, but be close enough together 
for mutual support. Trenches should zigzag or curve.
While barbed wire may not be 
available, interlaced tree limbs and sharpened stakes
can be used to slow down assaulters. 
Fortifications of any kind should be located so there
is a clear field of view in front of 
them. Rocks, low ground, or close trees and brush
would permit an enemy to get close 
without risk. Clear grass shrubs and other
obstruction out to at least fifty yards. Lay plain 
wire to trip and slow approach. Empty cans with
stones inside can be attached to these 
obstacles to make noise at night. Below are a few
simple types of field fortifications that 
could be used to protect a survival camp or other
position. A day practicing, digging, and 
using these kinds of fortifications would be time
well spent.
Urban combat is to be avoided whenever possible. The


--- Page 321 ---
cost and risk of this kind 
of combat far exceeds the value. Extensive training
is necessary to have any level of 
proficiency, and even the best military units take
heavy losses in urban environments. For 
a survivalist, home defense and a fighting escape are
the only urban combat necessities. 
The same principles of stealth, camouflage,
diversion, fire and maneuver, and counter-
ambush apply, but are all more complicated.
Multistory buildings add a third dimension 
to threats. Hiding places are everywhere for you and
for the potential enemy. Route 
selection must take into account how you are exposed,
where you can use concealment, 
where you can find cover, and where threats may lurk.
Open streets are almost always 
the worst routes. Moving house to house, yard to
yard, or alley to alley is much slower 
but often safer.
Defending your home against a few unorganized
criminals is achievable with good 
weapons, combat skills, and constant vigilance, but
defense against organized assault will 
be extremely difficult. The military would simply
flatten the adjoining houses, and cut 
down the trees to clear field of fire for automatic
weapons. You do not have these options. 
Adjoining houses may be occupied by shooters or set
on fire to drive you out. Walls and 
fences will provide cover and concealment for
shooters to get closer. While older, brick 
homes are basically bulletproof, frame houses and
brick veneer homes can be riddled by 
rifle fire. Once a group of more than two or three
has decided to besiege your home, you 
are in serious trouble unless you have organized a
block or community defense team. You 
should have evacuated already or have an escape plan
to execute before you are trapped. 


--- Page 322 ---
There is one other option. Instead of waiting for the
attackers to get to your home, you 
can go out and help your neighbors by ambushing or
outflanking the shooters before 
they get to you. Be careful, though; it’s a
calculated risk.
Physical Security
A single survivalist cannot remain at full alertness
for twenty-four hours a day. The 
entire family or group must be capable of completing
sentry duty at home or in a camp. 
Ideally, sentries should be on duty just one or two
hours, but no more than four hours 
per shift, and working in twos if possible. They may
be assigned to just look out from 
fixed positions or walk a perimeter or both. If a
perimeter patrol is established, it should 
--- Page 254 ---
238  James C. Jones
be done at irregular intervals and routes. A clearly
understood procedure for challenging 
intruders must be established and include a
consistent challenge phrase and password. 
These should be changed daily. Sentries are never,
ever stationed or permitted to sit 
around campfires or in lighted areas, and they should
avoid using flashlights as this will 
give away their location while ruining their night
vision. The sentries must be armed 
and have a method of alerting the other members if a
threat is imminent. The family 
or group should be ready and have an assault response
plan in place. If personnel are 
available, patrols can be sent out to detect signs of
activity in adjoining areas. Obstacles, 
barricades, and warning devices can be used to
inhibit surprise entry into a building or 
camp. Since firebombs are often used by looters and


--- Page 323 ---
criminals, all combustibles should 
be moved away from windows and wire screening can be
nailed over windows to deflect 
such devices. Most importantly, multiple large fire
extinguishers should be available.
Note: Keep in mind that in an age of infrared and
night-vision equipment and drones, 
well-equipped and authorized military and police
forces have much greater advantages 
than any unofficial force in the field, and under
extreme circumstance they could consider 
any noncompliant group (no matter how peaceful) to be
hostile.
--- Page 255 ---
239
127  �Should survivalists relocate to 
rural or wilderness areas?
While rural and wilderness areas have survival
advantages in many disaster scenarios, 
they also include their own hazards and
disadvantages. Remote locations are not immune 
to wildfires, floods, storms, earthquakes, and other
natural disasters. Violent crime is 
not limited to urban and suburban areas and access to
help is usually less available. Fire, 
police, and medical response times are much longer.
Power outages can be more extended 
and access to supplies may be more difficult. Such
locations are definitely less vulnerable, 
but not immune to civil disorder, looting, grid
failure, and epidemics. The priorities 
and needs for survival are essentially the same for
the rural survivalist, but the emphasis 
on long-term, shelter-in-place survival is greater.
The capacity and readiness to evacuate 
must still be maintained, even in remote locations.
The vast majority of survivalists live in 
urban, suburban, or small-town locations because they


--- Page 324 ---
have jobs, family, and educational 
responsibilities that outweigh other concerns. The
higher risks of these locations requires 
a higher level of awareness and preparedness.
Ultimately, it’s not where you are, but who 
you are that determines your survivability.
--- Page 256 ---
240
128  �How should a survivalist budget 
and spend for survival gear and 
supplies?
Unless you have unlimited funds, it is important to
establish a budget that constantly 
improves your survival and self-reliance capabilities
without seriously degrading your 
everyday life.
•       
Don’t waste money on survival stuff that is just
ordinary gear packaged as 
survival items. Survival water is just water.
Survival kits are just collections 
of things you could put together yourself, and
survival foods are usually just 
pasta, rice, and other ordinary grocery store items.
•       
Don’t buy overpriced survival items just because of
the brand name or 
advertising. Price does not always equate to higher
quality. Elite clothing 
brands, custom knives, and high-end firearms are not
functionally better than 
established quality items at lower prices. The money
spent for show is better 
spent on other practical supplies.
•       
Don’t be cheap on critical survival and self-reliance
items such as sleeping bags, 
packs, knives, flashlights, firearms, binoculars, and


--- Page 325 ---
packs. There are plenty of 
good-quality items at sporting goods stores.
•       
Military surplus knives, packs, tents, and other
items offer high quality at 
lower prices and are an excellent value for the
budget-minded survivalist. A 
good rule of thumb for survival items is that the
best values lie just below the 
most expensive, but never at the cheapest levels.
•       
If you have a limited budget and you are just
starting to develop your survival 
system, you may have to compromise on quality at
first in order to cover all 
of your needs. It would make little sense to spend
all your funds on a survival 
knife and a pack and not have any kind of stove,
water filter, firearm, or 
first aid kit. Once you have a complete set of
survival items, you can start 
upgrading. You can replace your used firearm with a
new, high-quality one. 
You can buy a better pack with stronger materials and
better design, etc. 
Remember that any survival item is better than
nothing. Once you start 
upgrading your equipment, your original items become
your backup.
--- Page 257 ---
241
129  �Should survivalists use social 
media and the internet to 
improve survival capacity and 
build survival networks?
The internet is the ultimate double-edged sword for
the survivalist. Social media provides 
the most effective way to promote survival education


--- Page 326 ---
events, gatherings, and network 
building. However, it also opens all of your
interests and activities to organizations, 
agencies, and individuals who regard survival and
self-reliance with suspicion and even 
hostility.
•       
Never share your personal emergency plans or
equipment acquisitions on social 
media. Showing pictures of yourself at a gun range or
showing off your latest 
firearm purchase is the height of poor personal
security. It’s not even wise to 
discuss specific plans or equipment in emails.
•       
While it may be beneficial to promote survival
meetups or educational events 
on the internet, specific emergency plans and group
activities should be strictly 
hard-copy and face-to-face communications.
•       
Consider the development of preestablished code
phrases and code words to 
be used on social media and other internet systems to
communicate survival-
critical information.
•       
The smart survivalist and survival group should
develop and use alternative 
communications systems such as CB, SW, GMRS, and
other methods.
No survival group or survival plan should depend on
the internet. It would be the height 
of foolishness for survivalists to depend on the
security and reliability of the very systems 
that a disaster would render dangerous or even
nonexistent.

130  �How can a survivalist prepare to 
survive an extended famine?
While storing food for emergencies is an essential
part of survival planning, and being able 
to produce some food items is a step toward self-
reliance, a famine is seldom considered 
as a disaster scenario. America’s climate and vast
areas of fertile lands make famine seem 
unlikely, but there are some scenarios where food
shortages could be severe and sustained.
•       
The food processing and distribution systems are so
complex and vulnerable 
that a cyberattack or other technical disruption
could prevent effective delivery 
of food from remote fields to high-density population
centers.
•       
Any disruption of fuel supplies would severely affect
harvesting, processing, 
and delivery of most foodstuffs. Petroleum is used to
power all farming 
machinery, create most fertilizers and insecticides,
and process and preserve 
many foods. The world supply of this commodity will
exhausted before the 
end of this century and will continue to be more and
more costly. Without 
large-scale farming, the current population levels
cannot be sustained.
•       
Any disruption of available labor such as an epidemic
or general civil disorder 
would stop all food processing and transportation.
•       
Terrorists could randomly poison foods, making all
vegetables and fruits 
potentially unsafe, or they could initiate biological
or chemical attacks on 


--- Page 328 ---
crops and livestock.
•       
Extremely cold weather conditions caused by volcanic
activity, solar variations 
or other situations could devastate crops on a
worldwide basis.
In many situations there will be initial looting and
even food riots in urban and suburban 
areas, but depending on the nature and extent of the
disaster, food shortages could extend 
into a general famine. If such conditions were to
develop in late autumn or early winter, 
it would take up to ten months for new crops to be
grown and harvested.
Food can be used to control and coerce populations.
Food is power. An oppressive 
or paranoid government could elect to take control of
the food supplies and use selective 
rationing to intimidate and starve opposition
elements.
In reality, famine is already a major issue in many
parts of the world. No population 
is immune to a potential famine.
The effects of a food shortage of any kind would be
immediate civil disorder and 
panic. Once all the stores and warehouses have been
looted, people would resort to 
stealing from each other. Gardens would be quickly
stripped. Those who could fish, 
hunt, or forage would do well for a while until all
of the game, fish, and edible plants were 
--- Page 259 ---
150 Survival Secrets  243
exhausted. The elderly, the ill, and the young would
the first ones to perish. Criminals 
and gangs would prey on anyone carrying food home and
would raid any residents who 
appeared to have food. In the early stages of a


--- Page 329 ---
famine, urban residents would travel to 
farms to trade or raid for food, but farmers would
quickly stop trading while organizing 
armed defenses against looters. The government would
establish rationing and no doubt 
a “black market” for food products would develop.
Famines usually burn out in a year or two as the
hungry population diminishes and as 
food supplies and systems adjust. Those who had
stored some food in advance, are good 
at foraging and living off the land, and are well
equipped to defend themselves and stay 
healthy, usually survive. Food is freedom, and food
is power, so the survivalist that has 
access to and control of significant food supplies
will survive and triumph during and 
after a famine.
--- Page 260 ---

131  �What can I do to prevent or 
survive a carjacking?
Modern vehicles are becoming more difficult to steal
from the street, so carjackings 
are an increasing probability in populated areas.
During a disaster, criminals and even 
desperate unprepared survivors may resort to force in
order to obtain a vehicle. The 
following recommendations apply to crime prevention
under normal conditions.
Park your vehicle in a well-lit area. When coming out
to the street, look around 
for suspicious people loitering nearby. If concerned,
go back inside and get others to 
accompany you. Do not go directly toward your vehicle
or activate the unlock button 
until you are just ready to jump in. This keeps
potential assailants from intercepting 
you. Try to observe under and around your vehicle and


--- Page 330 ---
adjoining ones as you approach. 
Windowless vans with sliding doors close to your
driver’s side are particularly suspicious. 
Lock your door immediately upon entry. Always drive
with your doors locked! Do not 
under any circumstances stop for someone other than
police flagging you down on the 
street. This is a common technique to make Good
Samaritans into victims.
Be very vigilant at stoplights at uninhabited
intersection. If someone points a gun at 
you while sitting at a stoplight you have three
options.
1.       Drive through the intersection.
2.       Say okay and slide out the passenger side
and run, leaving them with a running 
car.
3.       Turn off the vehicle, get out, and throw the
keys one way while running the 
other way.
Whichever you do, do it fast. Never ever let 
them get into the vehicle with you still inside 
or make you get back into the vehicle.
Carjackers and “snatch and run” thieves 
will approach from your blind spot while you 
sit at a traffic light or in a parking lot. Adding 
a convex mirror to your side mirrors can help 
you spot them as they approach close to the 
side of your vehicle. A mirror or two in your 
trunk lid will help you spot attackers close in 
on you while you are loading or unloading 
groceries.
Under disaster conditions where you may be trying to
escape or evacuating with your 
family and your survival supplies through lawless
areas, the display of weapons, the use 
The convex mirror gives a better view of the 
vehicle’s close side. 


--- Page 331 ---
--- Page 261 ---
150 Survival Secrets  245
of deadly force and running through those who attempt
to stop you would be justified 
and necessary. Your vehicle is essential to survival
under such circumstances. You cannot 
afford to be stopped, assaulted or put out into a
civil disorder environment.
--- Page 262 ---
246
132  �What can a survivalist do to 
prepare for a utility outage?
You do not have to live off the grid to be a
survivalist, but you do have to be able to live 
off the grid when necessary. The majority of natural
and man-made disasters result in 
some interruption of the grid, which provides life
essentials such as electricity, water, and 
fuel. A truly massive disaster could involve
temporary or even indefinite interruptions of 
electrical power, water, sewage systems, heating
fuel, gasoline, food deliveries, garbage 
pickup, fire departments, medical facilities, and
police protection. The general public 
has become completely dependent on centralized and
networked sources for virtually 
every need and has little or no capacity to cope with
their interruption for more than a 
few days.
•       
Natural gas–powered generators have become more
popular and are an 
excellent investment if affordable. Gasoline-powered
portable generators are 
a must, but can only be effective while gasoline is
available. There are many 
disaster scenarios where gasoline and even natural
gas will run out. The 


--- Page 332 ---
survivalist must be prepared to rely on alternatives
(e.g., solar-powered devices, 
candles, woodstoves) for any extended emergency.
•       
Sanitation systems are often overlooked in emergency
preparedness. Camp 
toilets and bleach should be part of every home
survival stock. Home toilets 
can be flushed with buckets of water as long as the
municipal sewage pumps 
are working. You may have to dig a pit toilet in your
yard or empty waste 
buckets into a pit as a last resort. Although you
will not have as much trash 
and garbage if the grid breaks down, you will not
have anyone picking it up 
either. A safe way to burn trash and biological (food
waste, etc.) garbage must 
be established. Remember that there will be no fire
department coming if you 
do not do this safely.
•       
Using up several gallons of water per day will
quickly exhaust your stored 
water supply. If you can install rain barrels on your
residence, it is an excellent 
investment. Gathering rainwater, pond water, and
water from nearby streams 
and lakes may be your only options. This water will
probably be contaminated. 
Boiling water takes fuel that you may not have. Using
bleach will work until 
your bleach supply runs out. Invest in a high-
capacity water-filtration system.
•       
Keeping warm in cold weather will be a serious
challenge during a long-term 
winter emergency. While modern homes are well
insulated, they are too large 
to be kept warm once the central heating systems are


--- Page 333 ---
inoperable. If you have a 
woodstove, fireplace, or camp heaters available,
close off one room to heat with 
--- Page 263 ---
150 Survival Secrets  247
this source. Leave faucets running very slowly (if
water is still on) to prevent 
freezing. If it is extremely cold, you may need to
drain the entire water system 
to prevent serious damage to your pipes. Sleep in
sleeping bags in the heated 
room. One of the best approaches is to put up a tent
inside your home and live 
in it until conditions improve. It will be much
easier to heat and light than a 
whole home would be.
•       
There is no such thing as alternative food. You
simply must have enough real 
food stored and available to last for months or even
a year or more. Hunting, 
fishing, and foraging will have limited potential
since desperate and even 
violent non-survivalists will quickly loot, hunt, and
fish everything dry. If you 
have already initiated survival gardening or even
raise some chickens or goats 
you are way ahead, but you will need to defend these
provisions. Skills like 
gardening, foraging, hunting, fishing, and canning
will have great value if the 
grid goes down indefinitely. Restocking seeds and
other survival food is a wise 
precaution.
•       
Since police, fire, and emergency medical services
will be delayed or 
unavailable a survivalist must have appropriate


--- Page 334 ---
firearms, fire extinguishers, and 
first aid equipment and training. In the case of
extended disaster situations, 
survival might require advanced equipment and
training.
Common short-term interruptions of utilities and
services only requires basic preparedness 
and may create discomfort and inconvenience, but
longer and more extensive interruptions 
may involve civil disorder, looting, mass
evacuations, epidemics, and martial law. While 
the survivalist may be able to live off the grid, the
unprepared and the non-survivalists 
will create additional challenges in many areas. If
the grid totally collapses, survivalists 
must be able to survive the initial effects and side
effects while transitioning to a new 
normal.
--- Page 264 ---
248
133  �What can a survivalist do to avoid 
being a victim of street crime?
In many ways, the law-abiding citizen during a
survival situation is in the same situation 
as a conventional army confronted by a guerrilla
ambush. You are carrying out normal 
operations and are deployed and equipped for getting
to work or buying groceries whereas 
the criminal has the initiative in selecting the
time, place, and method of attack. Just 
like a guerrilla, a criminal will want to strike hard
and fast and get away without being 
pressed or pinned down. The average street crime
takes from four to six seconds from the 
time the victim realizes it’s happening until the
time the criminal is gone. In the streets 
of today’s urban areas, a little paranoia is very
good thinking. Whether you’re walking or 


--- Page 335 ---
in your vehicle you should be thinking like you are
on a combat patrol where you are the 
point man, the squad leader, and the rear guard all
at the same time.
Deny the enemy a target
When possible, plan your route so as to avoid high-
crime areas, empty parking lots, and 
dark alleys, and if you must move through such areas,
plan to do it at times when it is 
light and most crowded. If someone wants to commit a
crime against you, make them 
come to your turf.
Deny the enemy confidence
One thing a criminal does not want is a fight, so
that person often looks for “soft” 
targets. A person walking along daydreaming, on a
cell phone, or looking down at the 
pavement tells a potential criminal that this target
is not alert and thus vulnerable. If 
you are marching along with purpose, scanning the
area for threats, and with your head 
high, the criminal will probably look for someone
else to attack. Your choice of clothing 
can help too. Someone wearing boots, a leather
jacket, and a buck knife on his belt is a 
lot less likely to get jumped than someone wearing
sandals, shorts, and a sweater. If you 
encounter a person or persons coming toward you,
never look down, keep your head up 
and look past them. Remember downcast eyes convey, I
am submissive and I will do what 
you tell me to do; never let anyone think that!
Remember that all your potential attacker 
knows about you is what he sees so if you look like
trouble he has to assume you could be 
trouble, and he does not want that.
Deny the enemy surprise
Remember that you are your own point man and the rear
guard, so as you move scan 
the whole area to identify potentially dangerous


--- Page 336 ---
spots and good ambush sites. From there 
--- Page 265 ---
150 Survival Secrets  249
you can plan your route to avoid what you can and
make a reaction plan for those you 
can’t avoid. Then as you move through the area, tune
your senses for noises, shadows, and 
odors. Additionally be alert: there are other people
along the route. What are they doing? 
Are they watching you? Can they intercept you? Are
their actions normal, or do they 
seem to be waiting for something? Fulfill your rear
guard duties by zigzagging slightly on 
the sidewalk and turning your head so you can get a
good view of what’s behind you. You 
should do this at least twice every block. Don’t put
yourself in the enemy’s kill zone where 
he can surprise you. Walk on the outside of the
sidewalk, or even in the street if necessary, 
so he has to come out of hiding (from alleys or
doorways) to attack. If your scan picks up 
a suspicious person or persons ahead of you, cross to
the other side of the street.
For your vehicle, be sure and buy a small stick-on
convex mirror and install on your 
left rearview mirror. Carjackers will approach from
your blind spot while you sit at a 
traffic light or in a parking lot. The extra mirror
will help you spot them. A mirror or two 
in your trunk lid or liftgate may help you spot
attackers who close in on you while you 
are loading or unloading groceries.
Deny the enemy the initiative
Rest assured that the criminal or gang has a plan. So
you must have a plan as well. Your 
plan should be simple because it’s often the simple
plans that work best. Remember when 
you are being attacked, you only have four to six


--- Page 337 ---
seconds, so you must know exactly what 
you are going to do, so you can react fast. Your plan
can be I will scream and kick like hell, 
or I will throw my bag and run the other way, or I
will start yelling as loud as I can. One 
idea is to have a money clip with a few dollars in it
(the clip gives it weight) that you can 
throw in one direction while running in the other
direction. Consider routes of escape 
(avoid dead ends) and potential safe havens such as
open stores, well-lit areas, and gas 
stations. Inventory your weapons (everything you have
can be a weapon) and how they 
can be used.
Deny the enemy privacy
Just like the guerrilla ambush, the criminal does not
want to have the cavalry show up 
and pin him down, so stay where there are other
people around. If you are about to board 
an elevator or a subway car, and don’t like the looks
of someone on board, don’t get in. 
Far better to ride the next elevator or train than
the next ambulance. When in doubt, 
listen to your instincts.
But if you do get into a confined space with a
potential assailant, there are some 
things that you can do. If you are attacked in an
elevator, do not push the emergency 
button, as it will stop the elevator; instead push
all the floor buttons and prevent the 
attacker from pushing the emergency button. This way
you have an escape opportunity 
every few seconds when the door opens.
In another scenario, never get in a car with a
potential attacker. If you are in your 
--- Page 266 ---
250  James C. Jones
car and a criminal points a gun at you, you can hit


--- Page 338 ---
the gas and take your chances with 
traffic or get out of the car, but do not let them
get into the car with you. If a potential 
attacker points a gun at you, run like hell. The
chances that he will shoot at you are about 
fifty-fifty. But your chances if you get into the car
with that person are slim to none. So 
whatever you do, don’t get in the car. At home you
should install motion-activated lights 
to cover your routes to the front door and garage. Be
sure to cut down bushes and place 
mirrors around the front of your house to deny
potential assailants anyplace to hide. Be 
sure to keep your vehicle locked and keep valuable
items out of sight. Get in the habit of 
parking your vehicle in the garage. If you have an
attached garage, be sure to keep the 
door from the garage to the house locked. This is a
common route of entry for home 
invaders.
Defensive Weapons
Criminals generally act on instinct. Responsible
citizens, on the other hand, will think 
about and analyze the consequences before using
deadly force. In the seconds it takes 
for an intelligent citizen to compute the 
probability of being wrong, the assailant 
will kill or disarm him. If you elect to 
carry a gun or a knife, you should be 
absolutely sure that you know how to 
use it and that you will use it without 
hesitation. If you have doubts, then 
you are just carrying a weapon that 
could potentially be turned on you. No 
matter what else you are carrying, in 
most cases having pepper spray units is 
recommended. Pepper spray is especially 
useful as cans are simple to operate and 
nonlethal; therefore almost anyone 
will use them without hesitation. They 


--- Page 339 ---
are very effective, come in sizes that fit 
almost anywhere, and are legal in most 
places. Pepper sprays have ranges of up to twenty
feet and will put down an attacker or 
several attackers for several minutes. In the event
that you do spray the wrong person, 
no lasting harm is done, and if it can be shown that
you had good reason to fear harm, 
you probably won’t face consequents. Keep one in the
car, in your pocket or purse, and a 
bigger one for home.
You don’t need to be Rambo to survive on the city
streets but you must make plans, be 
equipped, and maintain a high level of awareness.
Remember that predators always prey 
on the weakest and the slowest. In the urban (and
suburban) jungle, the unaware and the 
unprepared will perish. Don’t let it be you or those
you love.
Modern concealed-carry devices come in a variety of 
designs including enclosed carries that fit on the
belt 
and look like cell-phone cases, vests and jackets
with 
built-in holsters, purses with quick access pockets, 
and belt pouches like the one above.
--- Page 267 ---
251
134  �What is the foundation of having 
a strong will to survive?
A true survivalist has a well-founded will to survive
based on a sense of personal worth to 
others. A survivalist or survivor thrives because
they are self-motivating and self-defined, 
but not selfish. Those who give up are those who let
others define their value and are 
influenced by their place (or lack of one) in
society. A survivalist is never lost, never 


--- Page 340 ---
alone, and never without purpose, because they are
confident and adaptable, without 
outside support. Survivors live by the mottos, “I am
me,” “I am here,” and “I got this.” 
Survivalists are motivated to survive and overcome
hardship, pain, and struggle based on 
their understood value to the community, family, and
society. Because of this, survivalists 
are generally healthier, stronger, and less worried
than the unprepared, non-responsible 
denialists.
--- Page 268 ---
252
135  �How can I make my home more 
secure?
As social and economic conditions deteriorate, all
categories of crime will increase. 
Burglaries, home invasions, robberies, and assaults
are more common than most people 
realize. Having all of your survival equipment stolen
or being disabled in a robbery or 
home invasion is just as much a disaster as any
storm. Actions that you can take to 
improve your homes security are listed below:
•       
Lock your doors. It sounds logical, but a good number
of home invasions 
involve criminals just walking in. Criminals are
opportunists. Potential thieves 
may go from door to door just trying the knob. If the
door is locked, but they 
do not hear anyone inside, they will try knocking. If
there is no answer, they 
may try the back or side door. If still no answer,
they may just kick in the door 
and start taking things. If someone rattles your
door, you say, “who is it?” and 
they run, call the police.


--- Page 341 ---
•       
Beware of the distraction scam. If someone comes to
your door claiming to be 
a roofer, driveway coater, or utility worker, be
wary. Do not leave your house, 
and do not let this person in.
•       
Beware of the utility worker scam. Someone claiming
to be a utility worker 
could seek entry into your home to address a gas
leak, water leak, or other 
issue, and once inside, rob you. Never let anyone in
until you have seen their 
ID through your locked door and called the utility to
confirm their identity.
•       
Surprisingly, most illegal home entries are through
doors during daylight 
hours. All doors should be solid hardwood or steel
with high-quality deadbolt 
locks. When a door is kicked in, it is usually the
frame that breaks at the strike 
plate. If possible, have steel doorframes. Lock
strike plates come with short 
screws that only engage the doorframe. A hard kick
will almost always break 
the wood of the frame. Replace these screws with
longer two- or three-inch 
stainless steel screws that go well into the
adjoining wall studs.
•       
Install a peephole or have a security camera, so you
do not have to open the 
door to establish who is there.
•       
If you have an attached garage, treat the door from
the garage to the house 
as an exterior door. It should be strong with a
heavy-duty deadbolt lock and 
it should be kept closed and locked. Home invasions


--- Page 342 ---
are often made through 
attached garages.
•       
Be sure that your address numbers are big and easy to
read from the street, 
--- Page 269 ---
150 Survival Secrets  253
even at night. Small, hard-to-read numbers may cause
delays in police and 
EMS responses.
•       
Remove or trim bushes and shrubs that could provide
hiding places for 
criminals.
•       
Install motion-activated security lights.
•       
When on vacation, set interior lights and a radio on
timers to go on and off at 
night. Stop mail and paper deliveries or have a
trusted neighbor take them in. 
•       
Use your garage for storing your vehicles, not your
junk. Criminals just walk 
down streets at night checking for unlocked cars.
•       
Never leave valuables of any kind in plain sight in a
vehicle. It’s an invitation to 
break in even if it’s locked.
•       
Dogs are great security aids, and even if you don’t
have one you can leave a 
large dog food and water dish outside the door to
deter potential criminals.
•       
Never display so-called crime-deterrent signs, as
these will advertise that you 
have guns. This makes your home a high-priority


--- Page 343 ---
target for burglary when 
you’re not home. This can also harm your self-defense
claims if you do need to 
use deadly force.
•       
Do not post vacation plans on social media. Doing so
opens you up to all 
kinds of crimes and scams.
•       
Do not put the boxes from high-end items such as
televisions, generators, or 
appliances out by the street for garbage pickup. Tear
the boxes up and place 
them inside the cans.
•       
Keep your garage door closed.
•       
Be sure that all valuables are secure and out of
sight if you have guests or 
service providers in your home. Burglaries are often
committed by those who 
have been in the home before.
•       
Try to avoid being too predictable in your habits.
Coming and going at 
different times and from different directions will
discourage criminals. Taking 
a walk at the same time on the same route every day
is not good security.
•       
Stay alert every time you come home. Is there a
suspicious vehicle nearby? Have 
you been followed? Is someone lurking in the shadows?
Is your door ajar? If 
something doesn’t look right or feel right, keep
moving and get to a neighbor’s 
house or a police station. If you discover that your
door has been opened or you 
detect an intruder when you enter, get out
immediately, and call or go for help.


--- Page 344 ---
•       
Be sure that you have an intruder action plan for
your family.
•       
Case your house like a criminal. Does it look like
the easiest house on the 
block to target? Are there good places to hide and
access windows and doors? 
Is the car in the driveway locked or unlocked? Is it
unoccupied for part of the 
day?
--- Page 270 ---

136  �How can a survivalist prepare  
to survive a violent revolution?
While a revolution still seems improbable, America
has become so splintered that the 
political systems and governmental agencies may be
unable to prevent some segments of 
society from resorting to some forms of revolutionary
activities in the future. Because of 
this uncertainty, some of the following can happen:
•       
Racial and religious groups may resort to terrorist
activities, hostage taking, 
and sabotage.
•       
Mass demonstrations may turn into more organized
militaristic action where 
cities are taken over, and police and National Guard
units are overwhelmed. 
Radical groups might take over regional armories.
•       
Multiple states and/or cities could elect to assert
levels of independence, or even 
secede from state or national government, resulting
in massive disruption and 
conflict.


--- Page 345 ---
•       
Advocates of centralization and socialization and the
supporters of greater 
decentralization and personal freedoms could continue
to coalesce into strong 
opposing paramilitary forces.
•       
The government itself could become so oppressive and
intrusive that part of 
the population comes to resist and revolt.
In reality, most revolutions involve a very small
part of the population and a very limited 
area of major population centers, but the impact can
be massive. Even a limited and 
failed revolution could result in a collapsed
economy, martial law, and a more oppressive 
government. A large-scale revolution could destroy
cities and infrastructure, and 
initiate confiscation, mass internments, and the end
of most liberties. The survivalist’s 
preparedness and defensive arrangements will be of
great value during the chaotic 
conditions of any kind of insurrection.
Be aware of the political, economic, and social
climate, especially as it pertains to your 
immediate relationships, community, and interests.
Try to position yourself with the best 
chance of avoiding involvement. If you are not able
to avoid involvement, plan to survive, 
and stay free regardless of who wins. Avoid
commitment or overt support for potentially 
revolutionary or violent positions and groups. Stay
discreet and flexible. A reputation 
for responsibility and capability in your community
will be your most valuable asset. 
A strong and self-reliant population is the best
insurance against such a destructive and 
divisive event.

137  �What can a survivalist do to 
protect children?
Today’s youth are set to face increasing levels of
economic and social chaos, as well 
as more frequent and severe natural and man-made
disasters in the coming decades. 
Helping our youth to survive physically, mentally,
and morally is critical to the survival 
of a free society in the future. The following
recommendations provide basic guidance 
and information for parents and guardians for
surviving a variety of threat situations.
Home Accidents and Emergencies
Thousands of children are injured or die each year
from preventable home accidents. 
Other children suffer from physical and emotional
abuse from the very parents, relatives, 
and other adults who should be protecting them. It is
the responsibility of adults to 
provide a safe environment, be aware of potentially
hazardous conditions in the home. 
and act immediately when evidence of child abuse is
observed. Establish clear and 
reasonable safety rules and emergency procedures for
all family members.
Home Fires
Never leave young children at home alone. Children
are often fascinated by fire and 
may accidentally start a blaze and try to put it out
by themselves. Children are injured, 
trapped, and die like this every year. Never leave
matches, lighters, or other ignition 
devices lying about where children can get to them.
Teach children to get out of the house 
and call 911 or go to the neighbor’s house if there
is a fire. Adolescents can be taught to 
use a fire extinguisher and to evacuate younger
children if you’re not home.


--- Page 347 ---
Home Intruders and Invasions
Intruders may enter the home while the family is
asleep or enter while no one is there. 
They may intend to abduct children, commit robbery,
or commit other crimes. Parents 
must train the children on what to do.
If there is an intruder in the house at night, kids
should know to quickly gather in 
the parents’ room or designated safety spot and wait
for the police. They should never 
go looking for the intruder. If they cannot get to
the safety spot, they must have a place 
to hide.
If a forced entry is made by an intruder, the child
may lock and barricade their rooms, 
escape out a back door or window, or hide in a
cabinet or other location. If the child 
comes home may have been broken into, teach them not
to go inside. They should get 
away from the house, call 911, and go to a neighbor
immediately for help.

Children and Firearms
Firearms ownership is a serious responsibility. This
is especially true in any home 
where children live or may visit. If you are not
fully committed to keeping firearms 
out of the reach of children, then don’t have them.
Children have shot themselves, 
their siblings, and others with firearms that were
“hidden” by parents. Most children 
are extremely good at searching and finding. In a
drawer, under a cushion, on a high 
shelf, behind a cabinet—they will find it! All
firearms should be kept in a securely 
locked gun box, and the keys must be very well
hidden. Your self-defense gun(s) must 


--- Page 348 ---
be secured in a combination lockbox or with a trigger
lock at home. Ammunition 
and firearms should be stored separately. Adolescents
should be taught how to use 
firearms safely, but never permitted to handle them
without adult supervision. Even if 
you do not have children at home, be sure to lock up
all firearms when children will 
be visiting.
Other Hazards to Children
Tripping hazards are very dangerous for children, so
keep stairs and walkways clear. 
Children can climb on or over railings and fall off
porches, and through window screens. 
The installation of window and stairway guards and
gates is recommended wherever such 
hazards exist. Small children have drowned in buckets
full of water. Never leave children 
unattended in bathtubs or pools of any kind. Larger
backyard swimming pools must be 
fenced and locked when not supervised. Poisons such
as drain cleaners and paint thinners 
must be kept out of reach of children. The same
applies to prescription and over-the-
counter medications. Flammable liquids such as
gasoline, lamp oil, and solvents that are 
as hazardous as drugs (huffed), poisons, and fire
accelerants must be kept in secure locked 
cabinets. Obviously knives, saws, axes, and other
sharp objects must be kept out of reach 
of younger children. The handles of pans of boiling
or frying food must be kept inward 
so they cannot be grasped by children. The same goes
for dangling cords on hot electrical 
appliances such as coffeemakers and broilers.
Knowing How to Call 911!
All children should be taught how to call 911 at the
earliest possible age. They should 
be told to do so if anyone in the house is seriously
injured or unconscious, or if there is 


--- Page 349 ---
an intruder or attempted break-in, a fire, or serious
injury. Tell them to give their name 
and age, to describe the problem to the dispatcher,
and to follow the instructions given 
by the dispatcher.
Dangers on the Streets
Sad to say, our streets are no longer safe for
children. Child abductions, gang activities, 
drug use, and violence are not restricted to urban
communities. Suburban and rural areas 
--- Page 273 ---
150 Survival Secrets  257
have their own variations on these dangers. Parents
and young people living in so-called 
“safe neighborhoods” are inclined to become
complacent, easy targets for criminals.
Recognition of Child Abuse (including bullying and
cyberbullying)
Children may be molested or abused at home, at
school, or in other places by adults or 
other children; such abuse may include sexual
molestation, physical injury, emotional 
cruelty, or bullying. Since the sources of abuse may
include parents and other caretakers, 
it is the responsibility of all adults to be alert
for signs of abuse in children with whom they 
interact. Signs of abuse include: children who are
never outside or allowed to play with 
others; children who show signs of frequent injury or
seem fearful of adults; indications 
of malnutrition and illness; children that are
unusually quiet and inactive. Of course, 
some injuries are just accidents and some behaviors
are just mood swings, but multiple 
and ongoing signs of possible abuse should initiate
further investigation and reporting. 
Be suspicious if your child talks about spending time
with an older person or receiving 


--- Page 350 ---
gifts from or having secrets with an adult. Your
children should be told not to go into 
private locations or take gifts from any adults
without your permission. Listen, believe, 
and investigate when your children tell you about
inappropriate touching or suspicious 
action by adults, even if it’s a relative or someone
you know.
Preventing Child Abduction
Small children are easy prey for child molesters and
abductors. They may be lured into a 
nearby home by a sex offender or snatched outright
off the street. Abductors are skilled at 
misleading children. They may say they need help
finding a puppy, or they may say that 
a parent has been hurt and they will take the child
to them. Abductors may just want the 
child to get close enough to be grabbed. They may ask
for directions from their car or van 
and then pull them in when they get close. Children
should know that adults do not ask 
children for help. They should stay out of reach of
strangers at all times.
Be aware that most child abductors are not strangers.
They can be family members 
or acquaintances from home or school. Teach your
children never to go anywhere with 
anyone they do not know, but also not to go anywhere
with any adult without your 
permission. Train them to firmly say “no” and scream,
run, or fight. Remind them not 
get into a vehicle or take anything from strangers.
Encourage them to stay in crowds and 
stay in groups, and avoid being alone and avoid being
in empty places.
The police are not going to throw a lot of resources
into locating a missing child unless 
it has been over twenty-four hours or there are other
factors involved such as weather, 
disability, custody issues, threats of violence, or


--- Page 351 ---
evidence of violence or abduction. 
Ninety-nine percent of missing children turn up
within one to two days. After that, the 
chances of recovery become much less. Children over
the age of consent cannot be forced 
to return, even if they are located by the police. If
you are sure something is wrong, report 
it to the police and then start checking with the
child’s friends and at places where they 
--- Page 274 ---
258  James C. Jones
hang out. If you can’t locate the child within a day
or you find information indicating 
abduction, molestation, injury, or illness, get back
to the police immediately.
Recognition and Prevention of Bullying
Bullying can take many forms. Individuals or gangs
may use intimidation or physical 
violence to force a child to join a gang, take drugs,
or be involved in other high-risk 
activities. Children may choose to pick on a child
because he or she is different, or does 
not conform. The internet and social media are also
avenues for bullying. Cyberbullying 
is real and can cause lasting psychological harm in
sensitive children and adolescents. 
Be alert for signs of injury, depression, or changes
in behavior, such as skipping school 
or isolation that may indicate bullying. Children may
be ashamed to tell you that they 
let someone intimidate or injure them or that they
are afraid. The best defense against 
psychological bullying is the child’s own sense of
pride and self-worth. Being an important 
part of a family and knowing they have support and
can talk about issues is critical. Any 
signs of physical injury or organized bullying should
be reported to the police and/or 


--- Page 352 ---
school officials promptly.
Parental Awareness and Responsibility
Parents must be constantly observant of their
children’s behavior. Poor attendance at 
school or poor grades may indicate depression, drug
usage, or association with gang 
members. Frequently coming home late or sneaking out
should initiate investigation. 
Flashing gang signs, secretive behavior, or
indications of drug usage require immediate 
intervention. You are responsible for ensuring that
your children does not make serious, 
life-damaging choices. Adolescent brains are not
fully developed, and young people lack 
the benefits of experience and observation necessary
to make good decisions. You must 
be their guide and leader toward responsible and
productive adulthood. You cannot just 
be their pal and hope for the best. Regardless of the
situations or temptations, loved, 
confident, and self-reliant children are much less
likely to do drugs, join gangs, run away, 
or commit suicide. They are survivors in emergencies
and successful in life.
Preventing Accidental Injuries and Deaths
Young people are often overconfident and more prone
to taking chances than adults. 
The possibility of being seriously injured or killed
is not highly developed. Trying new 
things and pushing their luck is more normal than
being careful and safe. Today we 
have smartphones to completely distract and screen
young people from danger around 
them. Young people (and adults) are robbed,
assaulted, struck by vehicles, and experience 
collisions and falls because they were unaware of
their surroundings. These tragedies can 
and should be prevented. Devices that obstruct or
distract from complete audio and visual 
awareness should be used only when a person is


--- Page 353 ---
stationary and in a safe environment. 
Using such devices while biking, walking, skating, or
driving must be strictly prohibited. 
--- Page 275 ---
150 Survival Secrets  259
Even standing close to traffic, railroad tracks, or
in a location that may attract criminals 
should be avoided. Be sure to provide your children
with protective gear for whatever 
sports or activities they are involved in. Bicyclists
should be provided with good-fitting 
helmets and high-visibility clothing. If they ride at
night, they should have reflective 
clothing, and their bike should have reflectors as
well as lights.
Avoiding and Surviving Shooting Incidents
While drive-by shootings and gang shoot-outs are more
common in urban areas, they can 
happen anywhere without warning. Shooting incidents
happen far more frequently where 
young people congregate. Victims are often gang
members, but just as often they are just 
in the wrong place at the wrong time. The first
priority in preventing your child from 
being involved in such incidents is to keep them out
of gangs and keep them away from 
association with gang members. They also need to stay
away from locations where gang 
members are likely to hang out. The community must
provide alternative associations, 
activities, and locations. As always, you must have a
continuing dialogue with your 
children about associations and activities. Teach
your children to avoid association with 
anyone who carries a gun or brags about shooting
someone. Children should be taught 
that if they hear a gunshot, do not go to see what’s
happening, but must they get down 


--- Page 354 ---
and take cover quickly. If they think there is going
to be shooting, get away fast. Do not 
run toward or away from police, just stay down, show
your empty hands, and follow their 
exact instructions.
Hazards at School
Young people are subject to a tremendous amount of
hazards while in school. They spend 
much more time interacting with their peers than with
their parents. What seems to 
be acceptable within their group may be high-risk
behavior with potentially disastrous 
consequences. Their desire to fit in supersedes good
judgment. They seek leadership and 
a sense of belonging. Saying no and being different
take courage and determination. 
Home, family, and established values are their only
defense. Additionally, kids need to 
feel comfortable talking to you. As a parent, it’s
your job to get them through school safely 
and without making poor decisions and associations.
School hazards include, bullying, 
gang recruitment, drug pushers, assaults, and abuse.
In recent years incidents of so-called 
“active shooters” have also been more frequent.
Active-Shooter Situation Survival for Youth
A child or young adult may encounter an active-
shooter situation at school, in a public 
place, or even on the street. Young people must be
encouraged to report anyone in school 
who talks about shooting, killing, revenge, or having
guns or bombs. They should be 
trained to immediately report seeing a firearm being
carried into the school by a student 
or an adult. At the first sign of a potential
shooting incident or upon hearing shots fired, 
--- Page 276 ---
260  James C. Jones


--- Page 355 ---
they should know what to do. The school may have a
plan for a shooting incident, but in 
all cases, the child should know where to take cover
if evacuation is not possible. Getting 
out of sight behind solid walls or appliances is the
next-best option to escape. Barricading 
the door in a room is another way to stay safe. If
these are not viable choices, then lying 
flat and playing dead may be their only chance.
Running or just standing in place is an 
invitation to being a target in such situations.
Preventing Adolescent Drug Abuse
Most adolescents are highly susceptible to peer
pressure and the need to fit in. This often 
clouds their judgment. It’s just not enough to assume
that a child is “too smart” to try 
drugs or join a gang.
You should also be diligent about what you keep
around the house. Household 
chemicals such as paint thinner and adhesives can be
huffed. Alcohol can be consumed. 
Prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications
can be abused. Marijuana, heroin, 
cocaine, and a constantly changing variety of
synthetic drugs are out there for your child 
to try. So don’t wait. Discuss the dangers of drugs
with children in elementary school and 
continue the discussion each year. Discuss the health
and legal consequences and have 
examples from the news of how people deteriorated
physically, committed crimes, ruined 
lives, or died just because they tried something.
Children and adolescents often follow examples of
parents, relatives, and other adults. 
Parents who smoke, drink in access, use any form of
drugs recreationally, or tolerate such 
behavior among friends or associates are encouraging
drug experimentation and abuse 
regardless of what they tell their children. You must
set the example before you can 


--- Page 356 ---
prevent this self-destructive behavior.
Surviving Disasters (home, school outdoors)
The frequency and severity of disasters and violent
incidents is steadily increasing. Every 
family should be prepared to cope with emergencies
without help if necessary. Parents owe 
it to their children to assure that there is water,
food, shelter, basic first aid supplies, and 
other necessities on hand. An evacuation pack should
be ready for adults and children as 
well. As children grow older their level of emergency
responsibilities and their equipment 
should be improved.
School-age children should be taught basic first aid,
including how to recognize signs 
and symptoms of heart attacks, strokes, hypothermia,
hyperthermia, and insulin shock. 
They should be able to recognize severe versus minor
bleeding and how to apply direct 
pressure and elevation to stop it. Older children
should learn to administer CPR and 
apply tourniquets along with basic bandaging and
splinting. Children must know to 
“stop, drop, and roll,” if they are on fire and to
quickly cool and cover burns.
--- Page 277 ---
150 Survival Secrets  261
Lost or Separated Children
Regardless of how vigilant a parent or guardian is, a
child can become separated or 
lost. This may occur at a shopping mall, public
event, or outdoors. Children should be 
instructed to stay in one place as soon as they
realize they are lost or separated. Retracing 
your steps or going to the place you last saw them is
the best chance for fast recovery. 
Children should also be instructed to seek out a
police officer, security guard, event staff, 


--- Page 357 ---
or a store employee for help.
Storms, Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Power Outages
Children and adolescents need to know what to do if
they are home alone or away from 
home when severe storms, earthquakes, floods, power
outages, and other disasters occur. 
They should be instructed on how to escape, find
shelter, get to help and survive until 
you can get to them. They should be given increased
responsibilities in your family’s 
emergency plans as they grow older.
Family Passwords and Code Words
The family should have a special code word to imply
“I need help” and a password to 
use to imply, “it’s me, a family member.” You may
want to have special action words to 
activate various emergency plans as well.
Survival Kits for Children and Teens
An important survival imperative states that “it’s
not what you have; it’s what you have 
with you that counts.” Having age-appropriate items
to aid in emergency situations 
carried in pockets or packs can provide lifesaving
support in emergencies as well as 
providing a sense of comfort and self-confidence.
Having their own “survival items” and 
“survival kits” will develop a preparedness and self-
reliant mind-set that will serve them 
well as they mature to adulthood.
Early childhood survival items include a whistle,
Band-Aids, a miniature flashlight, 
and a child-size N95 respirator.* Some packaged,
nonperishable (for emergency use only) 
candy can also impart some comfort. A card containing
emergency contact information, 
the child’s name, address, and contact phone numbers,
and any medical conditions or 
required medications, should always be carried. This
card should be sealed in plastic. Do 
not depend on cell phones for this!


--- Page 358 ---
*Fires, tornadoes, chemical incidents, and biological
hazards all create airborne soot, dust, and 
mists that can be immediately harmful. It is
important that children and adolescents have a 
means to protect themselves from these risks. Child-
sized respirators can be purchased online. 
Buy enough to cover an extended (epidemic, etc.)
situation and show the child how to properly fit 
them. Adolescents will be able to use adult-sized
respirators.
--- Page 278 ---
262  James C. Jones
As children grow older, more 
survival items can be added such 
as energy bars, light sticks, pepper 
spray, survival blankets, bandanas, 
and even tourniquets. More complete 
survival kits should be created for 
children and adolescents to take 
on outdoor activities and there 
should be a full evacuation pack of 
appropriate content, size, and weight 
for young family members as well.
About Knives and Children
Years ago, the possession of a pocketknife was a rite
of passage for young boys. They 
were usually small one- or two-bladed knives. These
were never used or considered to be 
weapons. Today carrying a knife of any sort to school
is prohibited. Regardless, a pocket 
knife, Swiss Army knife, or multi-tool device is
still an essential survival item for non-
school pockets and kits, but should come with
parental supervision and safety training.
Youth Interaction with Police
Young people must understand that police officers are
sworn to enforce the laws and 
protect the public. Children should be introduced to


--- Page 359 ---
police officers at an early age and 
come to see them as sources of safety and help.
Violence of any kind is the last resort for 
a police officer, but when faced with a threat to
themselves or others, they are obligated 
to act.
The police do not just go around shooting innocent
people walking down the street. 
Although some police shootings are overreactions or
accidents, they sometimes are 
situations precipitated by the victim’s criminal
activities and/or failure to promptly obey 
police commands. If a person appears to be armed,
appears to be a threat to others, or 
fails to obey commands the police are justified to
use deadly force. They are not allowed 
to simply let the offender run off. For an officer to
fail to do everything within his or her 
power to detain the suspect is termed as a failure of
duty, and the officer or officers are 
subject to disciplinary action and possible
termination. They are not obligated to try to 
chase and tackle an offender that may well be faster
and stronger than they are. They are 
obliged to stop the offender by the most effective
means necessary while minimizing the 
risk of injury to themselves and others.
Children and adolescents must be taught the following
rules by their parents and 
guardians in order to prevent tragic occurrences.
•       
Don’t be involved in criminal activities.
•       
Don’t do drugs.
--- Page 279 ---
150 Survival Secrets  263
•       
Don’t hang around gangs or act and dress like a gang


--- Page 360 ---
member.
•       
Don’t run when the police say stop.
•       
Don’t point things (any things) at the police.
•       
Stop and obey every police order immediately.
•       
Do not fight or struggle with officers.
As parents and guardians, you must not tolerate or
enable children’s participation in 
any kind of criminal, gang, or drug-related
activities. Further, do not tolerate criminal 
activities or drug usage by friends and family
members. Teach them the above rules 
for avoiding violent police/civilian confrontations.
Teach them self-respect, respect for 
others, and respect for the law and make them safe,
responsible, and productive citizens. 
That’s your job.
--- Page 280 ---
264
138  �What are the alert levels used 
by survivalists to classify threat 
conditions?
While being alert and observant of potential threats
is the hallmark of good survival 
thinking, no one can be constantly at a state of
maximum readiness. It is unreasonable 
to expect anyone to be at the same level of alertness
while relaxing at home as they would 
be walking down a darkened street in the city. Many
survivalist adopt a military-like, 
multilevel system to establish how ready they are to
act based on their environment and 
potential threats. An example of this type of system
is as follows:
Condition Green


--- Page 361 ---
All conditions are normal and safe. You are in a
familiar and secure environment and 
there are no threatening conditions inside or
immediately outside the location. Relax.
Condition Yellow
You are in a relatively safe and familiar environment
such as your job, the road, or a 
store, but there are potential hazards such as street
crime, accidents, weather conditions, 
strangers, or other concerns. You need to be aware of
everything going on around you. 
Look, listen, and smell for hazards. This condition
should also always apply to cases 
when you are in an unfamiliar environment such as
hotels, airports, outdoor venues, and 
wilderness areas.
Condition Orange
The potential for a life-threatening occurrence is
evident. Your location is a fire hazard 
or has too few exits, you are in a crowd, there are
suspicious people ahead, and dangerous 
storms are possible. Or you just feel like something
is off. This is the time to move to a 
safer location, acquire needed survival items, and
make a mental plan for possible escape, 
shelter, defense, and survival.
Condition Red
You recognize that you are in immediate danger.
Criminals start moving toward you, you 
smell smoke, you hear shooting, a weather warning is
given, and signs of panic are evident. 
Because you anticipated the possibility of such
dangers you immediately execute your plan 
using the survival skills you have learned and the
survival items you have with you. You 
are therefore able to save yourself and those you
care for most, and then can help others.
--- Page 281 ---


--- Page 362 ---
265
139  �What kind of vehicle is best for a 
survivalist to have for evacuation 
from a disaster?
The ideal survival vehicle is a military Armored
Personnel Carrier, or heavy-duty, four-
wheel drive truck. Commercial four-wheel drive pickup
trucks and large SUVs are also 
suitable, but such vehicles are expensive and usually
impractical for everyday use. Fully 
equipped survival vehicles are bound to attract
attention and take up room. Unless you 
can afford to have multiple, high-end vehicles, you
will probably need to compromise by 
having one vehicle that has some survival
functionality and can be quickly rigged for an 
escape; or by having another basic commuting vehicle
and a second more capable vehicle 
that can be used for survival situations.
There are four primary considerations for your chosen
survival and escape vehicle in 
order of priority:
1.       Reliability: Your designated survival
vehicle must be the one with the least 
mileage, best maintenance, and newest tires and
battery. Its fuel tank should 
never be much below three-quarters full.
2.       Roominess: You need to have room for the
whole family and all of your 
survival gear and supplies. This means having a mid-
sized SUV or pickup truck 
with a cap. Vans can be eliminated, as they are
generally unstable and have 
low ground clearance. Keep in mind that you may
actually have to live in the 
vehicle.
3.       Range: Having too large a vehicle with poor
gas mileage may be a problem 
when all of the fuel sources are unavailable. Part of
your selection process should 


--- Page 363 ---
consider if you could expect to get to a safe
location on one tank of fuel through 
traffic jams. Having the capacity to carry fuel cans
safely should also be a 
consideration. Some trucks and SUV offer auxiliary
fuel tanks.
4.       Ruggedness: Reliability, room, and range
must outrank ruggedness, but it is an 
important factor. Jeep-like vehicles, with four-wheel
drive or all-wheel drive,* 
and high ground clearance are preferable. These
features will help get through 
mud, snow, and rough terrain.
*The terms “four-wheel drive” and “all-wheel drive”
are interchangeable. Both can be robust and 
effective for slippery conditions and rough terrain.
The term “all-wheel drive” is usually used for 
larger SUVs and sedans, whereas “four-wheel drive”
usually applies to trucks and larger SUVs 
with higher ground clearances.
--- Page 282 ---
266  James C. Jones
Recommended Vehicle Equipment:
•       
Spare gas cans, with at least ten gallons of extra
fuel
•       
A liquid transfer pump or siphoning tubing
•       
Towrope or chains
•       
Come-along winching device and cable
•       
Spotlight that runs off of the accessory plug
•       
Camouflage netting
•       
Carpeting strips (12" x 48") for traction


--- Page 364 ---
•       
Battery-powered air pump and tire repair kit
•       
Jumper cables and/or portable power pack
•       
Six to eight smoke bombs for escape and diversions
•       
Flares
•       
Fire extinguisher
•       
Bolt cutters to access closed roads and garages
The above list is what you should keep in that
vehicle or can quickly load into it. It does 
not include all of your survival packs and supplies
that you must have ready for easy and 
fast loading as well.
Accessories that can improve a vehicle’s survival
functionality when practical to install 
include:
•       
Electric winches
•       
Towing hooks
•       
Bumper guards
•       
Extra running lights and spotlights
Unless you live in an area where camouflaged painted
vehicles are common, select dark 
shades of gray, tan, and brown.
Trailers offer a good option for survival
preparedness. You can load up a small trailer 
with all of your survival needs and keep it in the
garage, ready to go. Of course you 
do need to have a sufficiently robust towing vehicle
with a hitch. Trailers can also be 
pre-positioned outside the danger zone to be picked
up on your escape route. A small 
camping trailer or cargo trailer can be stored at a


--- Page 365 ---
remote storage facility or secure yard. 
While a larger house trailer or camper bus may seem
ideal, they may inhibit mobility and 
will require a bigger towing vehicle and lots of
fuel.
--- Page 283 ---
267
140  �Should survivalists establish 
hidden caches of survival 
supplies?
In many cases the survival equipment you can
transport may be insufficient for the 
severity and duration of the threats and challenges
you are facing. Once your vehicle 
is stopped or your survival pack supplies run out,
you may need to have pre-positioned 
supplies on your route or at your final destination.
Having your survival pack and all your supplies in
your home creates some risks. You 
may want to consider keeping your packs or a backup
pack in a shed or detached garage. 
That way, if your home burns down, you still may have
your pack.
If a disaster such as a flood, hurricane, or civil
disorder seems to be approaching, you 
may want to temporarily shift some of your supplies
to a safer area. Consider asking a 
friend or relative to hold a few packs or tote bins
for you.
Caches established for serious disasters must be
outside of the zone of chaos and 
destruction but accessible along your route or at a
destination within a few days’ travel. If 
you have close friends or relatives living in a safer
and more remote location, they may be 
willing to store your additional supplies in a shed,
detached garage, or basement for you. 
In a disaster, they will probably welcome the extra


--- Page 366 ---
help and defensive capabilities you will 
bring. This is an excellent function of a survival
group or networks.
Wilderness survival caches are usually buried in the
woods or desert. They give the 
survivor the capacity to survive off the grid and out
of sight, but are vulnerable to theft 
and damage.
No cache is of value if it cannot be located and
accessed quickly. Finding a location 
off the beaten path, out of sight, and yet easy to
access, can be challenging. Establish 
the location by triangulation and reference to
permanent, visible landmarks such as 
buildings, large trees, or rock formations. You can
also establish the spot using GPS 
locators, but be skilled in map and compass usage in
case GPS is not available during a 
disaster. Avoid placement of caches in low or marshy
ground where they are more apt to 
be damaged by water.
Cache containers must be absolutely watertight and
corrosion proof. Large-diameter 
PVC pipes with threaded caps make good containers.
Heavy-duty plastic military 
ammunition cans are also suitable. All contents
should be placed in sealed, heavy-duty 
plastic bags. Weapons and other metal gear should be
heavily greased. Cache locations 
should be inspected annually and dug up, inspected,
and relocated every two to three 
years.
The contents of caches depends on the anticipated
needs of the survivor beyond the 
first few days of a disaster, but could include:

•       


--- Page 367 ---
Blankets, sleeping bags, and shelters for winter
survival that goes beyond what 
you can carry in your packs.
•       
Nonperishable food supplies to keep you going when
your pack supplies run 
out.
•       
Stoves, lanterns, and fuel for light and heat.
•       
Ammunition for your carried survival weapons and
maybe a backup weapon 
and ammunition in case yours is lost or unaccusable.
•       
An entire small survival pack with all water,
shelter, food, defense, medical, 
and other needs, in case (worst case) you cannot get
to your primary pack or it 
is lost.
•       
Recovery supplies such as seeds, tools, and trade
goods.
Caches can be a significant advantage in a survival
situation. Use your imagination to 
create locations, containers, and contents.

141  �How important are health and 
physical conditioning to being a 
survivalist?
The answer should be obvious. Poor health and poor
physical conditioning reduce your 
chances of surviving in every conceivable emergency.
Reduced muscle tone, lung capacity, 
and heart health will severely limit your ability to
run, carry equipment, fight, work, 
and lift. High blood pressure, diabetes, and other
issues can be fatal under the stress 


--- Page 368 ---
of a disaster. Poor teeth can limit your diet, cause
pain, and lead to infections. Being 
overweight and out of shape puts you at a
disadvantage in any demanding situation. 
Dependency on any kind of commercial medication
severely limits your survival chances 
in the long run. While we cannot always avoid
illness, and we are bound to suffer some 
effects of aging, there is no excuse for allowing our
physical condition to decline more 
than necessary. There is little point in packing a
survival pack that you probably will not 
be able to carry, or learning survival skills that
you will not be strong enough or tough 
enough to perform in an emergency. Depending on age,
heredity, and early development, 
we all start with basic physical capacities, but we
must do all we can to improve and 
enhance what we have. Some of those ways are:
•       
Walking is one of the most beneficial and easiest
exercises. Never drive when 
you can walk. You should try to walk at least ten
miles per week.
•       
Establish a habit of exercising at least three time
per week. Build abdominal 
muscles, arm muscles, back muscles, and shoulder
muscles that you may need 
in an emergency. Join a health club if you can or
invest in some weights and 
other basic exercise gear. Push-ups, sit-ups, and
various lifts and bends do not 
require expensive machinery. The self-discipline and
determination required to 
sustain an exercise regimen is precisely the kind of
mental ability required for 
survival.
•       
Stop smoking if you do. Dozens of ailments and


--- Page 369 ---
limitations are caused by 
smoking and nicotine products. Most smokers can’t
keep up with most 
nonsmokers who are much older. There is no such thing
as a smoking survivalist.
•       
Depending on one’s metabolism, dieting may be
necessary to manage one’s 
weight. In a survival situation a few extra pounds
may even be beneficial. 
Limit calories and exercise regularly to manage
weight and cholesterol, while 
reducing fat and sugar intake as well.
•       
Be sure to maintain your teeth and get regular dental
checkups and eye 
examinations. These services may not be available
during long-term disasters.
--- Page 286 ---
270  James C. Jones
•       
Get regular medical checkups, but try to avoid
dependency on medications 
when diet, exercise, and healthy habits can suffice.
•       
Don’t let age be an excuse for letting yourself go.
If you lack the will to stay 
healthy, you probably lack what it takes to survive.
A survivalist does not have to be a physical fitness
enthusiast or fanatical dieter, but must 
be committed to basic health and physical fitness as
a fundamental necessity.
--- Page 287 ---
271
142  �When did the survivalist 
movement begin?


--- Page 370 ---
Self-reliance and personal preparedness are
fundamental American values that originated 
with the first colonists. The agrarian and pioneer
culture of the 1700s and early 1800s 
made most people survivalists by nature until the
Industrial Revolution shifted the masses 
toward dependency on centralized networks and
regulated lifestyles. By the twentieth 
century, the majority of Americans had lost the
capacity to do without systems that 
provided life necessities such as running water,
electricity, automotive transportation, 
police protection, central heating, packaged foods,
and other services.
The advent of nuclear weapons after World War II was
the first cause for a limited 
number of Americans to consider the fragility of
civilization. The vast majority of persons 
considered nuclear war to not be survivable and chose
to ignore any level of preparedness or 
self-reliance, but a small percentage became
survivalists and self-reliance advocates. From 
there, survivalists and survivalism became prominent
in the 1980s at the height of the 
Cold War and many of the core philosophical
foundations were established at that time. 
While the danger of nuclear war diminished somewhat
after the collapse of the Soviet 
Union in the 1990s, the public began to acknowledge
the weakness and vulnerabilities of 
their centralized and precarious support system. This
realization generated the prepper 
movement That has become a recognized phenomenon. As
the economy declines, climate 
extremes occurs, and social chaos increases,
survivalism (or prepping) is becoming 
mainstream by necessity, and survivalists are
grudgingly recognized as positive examples.


--- Page 371 ---
--- Page 288 ---
272
143  �What is the rule of threes in 
survival and preparedness?
The rule of threes in survival states that you must
always have three methods or devices 
available to meet every critical life need. The
chances of losing or having a single system 
fail are fairly good under survival conditions. The
odds of two methods failing are 
significantly lower, but having three devices,
methods, or systems fail are very, very low. 
This is why NASA and the military use triple
redundancy whenever possible. The table 
blow covers some alternative and backup methods:
Life Critical

Primary method
Secondary

Other 
Alternatives

The rule of threes also applies to survival plans and
tactics. Have three ways of getting 
to a destination, three ways to survive any
situation, and at least three plans for every 
anticipated survival challenge.
--- Page 289 ---


--- Page 373 ---
273
144  �What if I make all these efforts 
to prepare and nothing bad 
happens?
Simply, most scientists, economists, historians, and
anthropologists agree that civilization 
is moving toward a traumatic catastrophe of some kind
in the not to distant future. No 
one is predicting a safe and benign tomorrow. While
there are temporary and inspiring 
recoveries and progress in some areas, the overall
trends in every aspect are downward. In 
the past when humanity ran out of resources and
became desperate, they migrated to new 
areas, but now there is nowhere left to go. The
philosopher Georg Hegel (1770–1831) 
postulated that civilization moved from epoch to
epoch, destined for an end point. Karl 
Marx heard this idea and twisted it to mean that we
were marching toward a utopian 
socialist society. While he was wrong about that
particular end, Marx did also say that 
every system contained the seeds of its own
destruction. In that he seems to have been 
correct. Destruction appears to be nearing. To fail
to prepare is dangerous, irresponsible, 
and a betrayal of our children and our future. If
nothing bad happens, you are still a 
stronger and more responsible citizen, but if
anything catastrophic does develop that 
you’re not prepared for, you will lose a great deal
because of your very unwise gamble.
--- Page 290 ---
274
145  �What should a survivalist keep in 
a disaster first aid kit?
First and foremost, stock up on your prescription
medications. Hoard any antibiotics 


--- Page 374 ---
and painkillers while you can. Although most
medications expire in two years, they are 
often effective for much longer, especially if vacuum
packed and kept cool. You must 
have a basic first aid book to ensure that you can
administer effective and safe medical 
procedures. The following is a partial list that
could be expanded depending on your 
needs and skills.
  1.     1 package of blood stoppers (Celox, QuikClot,
and HemCon) powder or 
dressing
  2.     1 tourniquet device
  3.     1 eight-ounce tube of antibiotic ointment
(e.g., Neosporin 9%)
  4.     1 eight-ounce tube of hydrocortisone cream
  5.     1 eight-ounce tube of tube burn ointment
  6.     1 bar of antibacterial soap
  7.     12 alcohol swabs
  8.     1 bottle of nonprescription pain medication
(e.g., Tylenol)
  9.     1 bottle of nonprescription antacid
10.      1 bottle of nonprescription antidiuretic
11.      1 bottle of nonprescription laxative
12.      1 bottle of nonprescription cold and allergy
medications
13.      1 three-ounce bottle of eye drops
14.      1 two-inch elastic bandage
15.      1 three-inch elastic bandage
16.      2 triangle (cravat) bandage/sling
17.      24 assorted small bandages (Band-Aids)
18.      20 butterfly bandages
19.      12 2x2" gauze pads
20.      12 3x3" gauze pads
21.      12 4x4" gauze pads
22.      12 safety pins (large)
23.      1 pair of EMT shears
24.      Assorted tweezers and forceps
25.      1 pair of splinter forceps and/or tweezers
26.      4 single-edged razor blades or scalpel


--- Page 375 ---
blades with blade holder
--- Page 291 ---
150 Survival Secrets  275
27.      1 toothache kit (available at drugstores)
28.      6 pairs of latex gloves
29.      6 N95 respirators
30.      2 CPR masks
31.      1 roll of 1" self-adhering tape
32.      1 roll of 2" self-adhering tape
33.      1 roll of .5" medical tape
34.      First aid instruction book
If you have advanced medical training you may have a
lot more supplies including surgical 
kits and suturing kits. Starting with an off-the-
shelf military surplus kit and then adding 
supplies is a fast way to build your kit.

146  �What should a survivalist do to 
survive a home invasion?
As economic and social conditions deteriorate, home
invasions will become more 
common. Nice homes in nice communities are
increasingly the targets of these violent 
crimes. In the case of economic collapse, once stores
are looted and the relief agencies are 
exhausted, the desperate and unprepared will turn to
home invasions on a massive scale. 
The suggestions below apply to home invasions during
“normal” times when the police 
are available. More aggressive “home defense”
measures may be necessary during a large-
scale and extended civil disorder situation.
Intruder Prevention and Survival
•       
Don’t hesitate to call the police at the first sign


--- Page 376 ---
of attempted entry. Any 
hesitation or procrastination only gives the
criminals time to find a way in.
•       
Do not open your doors to strangers or let them lure
you outside.
•       
Always lock your doors, even if you are going just a
short distance. Lots of 
burglaries are facilitated by unlocked doors.
•       
Attached garages are a prime access point for
burglars and home invaders. 
Residents tend to regard the door from the garage to
the home as an interior 
door, but the garage door is often open or is far
less secure. Have the same 
deadbolt locks on the garage access door. Keep the
vehicle door closed when 
not entering or exiting and always lock the garage-
to-house door.
•       
Potential home invaders and burglars may watch your
home to see when you 
are out and when you come in or they may follow you
from work or a place 
you frequent. Varying your schedule and routes can
help. Be alert for anyone 
casing your home or following you.
•       
Home invasions or break-ins are often crimes of
opportunity. There are people 
who just go around knocking on doors and trying the
handles. If no one 
answers they try the other doors. If no one seems to
be home, intruders break 
in. This may start as just a burglary, but if it
turns out that someone is home 
or comes home, you could have a hostage or murder
situation. Lock the doors. 


--- Page 377 ---
Call police if suspicious people are checking window
and doors.
•       
Never enter your home or anyplace if you suspect it
has been broken into. If 
you enter and see signs of an intruder, get out
immediately and call police. Do 
not go looking for the intruder!
•       
Look around before entering your home. An intruder
can slip in behind you 
--- Page 293 ---
150 Survival Secrets  277
as you are driving into your garage or sneak up
behind you as you unlock your 
front door. This is often how a home invasion starts.
•       
If taken hostage on the street, avoid letting them
take you to your home.
•       
There is no doubt that the first thing the intruders
will do is take your cell 
phones and disconnect the landlines. A few extra cell
phones hidden about 
may come in handy. Remember that even out of service
cell phones can call 
911.
•       
Have a code word or phrase worked out with your
family to let them know you 
are being held hostage. The invaders may want you to
call a family member 
or answer a call. This would be a chance to get help
without tipping off the 
intruders.
•       
If you don’t have children, you may want to consider
hiding a few firearms 


--- Page 378 ---
where you can get to them quickly. In addition to the
bedside drawer, the 
living room and kitchen are good places to hide
weapons.
•       
Once you are under the control of the intruders, your
options are greatly 
reduced. In most cases intruders will injure or kill
victims. If multiple family 
members are present, running in different directions
and breaking through 
windows to escape is better than waiting for
execution. Do this before you are 
tied up.
•       
If you do find yourself this situation, remember that
this is your territory. 
You have some advantages in knowing where things are
and places to hide or 
escape. Think scenarios through ahead of time.
•       
Home security systems are great, but if the intruders
know about them, they 
can disable or disarm them. Having firearms at home
can save your life, but 
advertising the fact gives away much of the advantage
and may even invite 
burglars when you are not home.
--- Page 294 ---
278
147  �What should I do if the intruder 
enters while I am asleep?
If you awaken to the sound of someone breaking into
your home, you must act quickly 
and carefully before the intruder gets to you and
realizes that you are awake. Hopefully 
you have placed your cell phone on the bedside table
and weapons and a flashlight in your 


--- Page 379 ---
bedside drawer. Your actions should include the
following:
•       
If you can do so quietly, close and lock your bedroom
door. This will buy you 
a bit of time and make it harder to be heard as you
call the police.
•       
Immediately dial 911. Tell them that an intruder or
intruders are in your 
home. Also give them your location and inform them of
where other family 
members are located within the home, and note whether
you are armed or 
unarmed. Stay on the line and follow instructions.
•       
Do not go looking for the intruder. Take up a
defensive position that blocks 
access to you and your family and offers concealment.
Wait for the police.
•       
If the intruder approaches, you are not obliged to
give them a warning before 
taking action, but you want to be sure it is actually
an intruder (not a family 
member or the police). Of course, the preferred
outcome is a retreating 
intruder caught by police, not violence, in your
home.
•       
If the intruder ignores the warning and/or continues
toward you and your 
family, you are justified in shooting. Be sure you
are positioned so that shots 
will not endanger other family members in adjoining
rooms.
•       
Once the police arrive, put down your firearm and
turn on interior lights. You 
don’t want the police to confuse you with the


--- Page 380 ---
criminal.
•       
Regardless of the circumstances of a shooting, you
must obey all police 
instructions and do not say anything until you have a
lawyer present.
--- Page 295 ---
279
148  �Should a survivalist get 
involved in community safety 
and emergency preparedness 
organizations?
The stronger and better prepared your community is,
the safer you are. If your town or 
county has a Crime Watch, Civilian Emergency Response
Team (CERTS), a Volunteers in 
Police Service (VIPS) program, or other programs to
involve citizens in crime prevention, 
safety, and emergency response, it is in your best
interest to support and participate in 
such programs. Encouraging local officials to
initiate civilian support programs and 
sponsor preparedness seminars and fairs can
strengthen your community and provide 
another layer of protection and support during a
disaster. Participants in such programs 
usually receive training and inside information
beyond what uninvolved citizens will get. 
Being officially certified usually provides access to
or passage through areas denied to 
the public during an emergency. Volunteers for these
organizations are usually subject to 
screening and are held to higher standards of conduct
and responsibility than ordinary 
citizens.
--- Page 296 ---


--- Page 381 ---
280
149  �What are the moral obligations of 
a survivalist in helping his or her 
unprepared neighbors?
Taking time to learn survival skills and spending
some of your money on survival supplies, 
puts you on the moral high ground. By completing
these tasks, you have done your 
duty as a responsible citizen. Since you are not a
danger or a burden to the community, 
you have already helped others, but you also have the
opportunity and the choice to 
provide reasonable assistance to deserving neighbors.
You are not morally obligated to put 
yourself or your family in jeopardy to help those who
have chosen not to prepare.
Making hard decisions will be easier if you have
offered to help neighbors and friends 
get prepared beforehand. Providing literature,
sponsoring preparedness programs in your 
community, and advocating preparedness will make it
easier to say “no” when you must 
say “no.” If you truly feel that someone you know
cannot be prepared, consider putting 
together some supplies and a pack for them. Whenever
you do provide supplies to others, 
it is important to state that you have limits.
Ultimately you have to make decisions on a 
case-by-case basis. Some suggestions on dealing with
certain situations are listed below:
•       
In some instances people who did prepare and are good
neighbors will still be 
in need. They deserve your compassion and help.
•       
You may have already created a network of supportive
neighbors or friends. If 
they have done their part, then you must reciprocate.
•       
Those who are helpless, nonaggressive, or are


--- Page 382 ---
refugees can be aided according 
to your abilities without endangering yourself.
•       
Those who have totally ignored preparedness,
belittled survivalists, and have 
been selfish in the past do not deserve any support.
•       
Those who are threatening, violent, and aggressive
must be turned away and 
resisted. Any show of weakness or compassion will
only invite assault and 
looting.
Disasters and large-scale catastrophes are
opportunities for the survivalist to be 
compassionate and helpful to others in time of need.
You are not obliged to become a 
victim yourself. You cannot be your neighbor’s keeper
if you are unable to help yourself.
--- Page 297 ---
281
150  �What questions should a 
survivalist ask him- or herself?
A questioning attitude is the hallmark of an
intelligent individual and an essential element 
in survival thinking. The answers to the previous 149
questions should have provided 
you with essential survival information, established
sound philosophical guidelines, 
and strengthened your abilities to cope with the
material, physical, and psychological 
challenges of both rapid and slow-developing
disasters. Ultimately there are important 
questions that the survivalist must ask him- or
herself. A few of those self-examining 
questions are listed below.
•       
What is my mission in life? Knowing and defining
one’s reasons for living is 


--- Page 383 ---
the foundation of a strong will to survive and a
guide for preparedness and 
survival actions.
•       
What are my priorities in daily life and in
preparedness that will make be 
stronger and more self-reliant?
•       
What habits, associations, and dependencies do I have
that I should 
discontinue in order to be healthier, freer, and
better prepared?
•       
What are my values and my responsibilities to the
future?
•       
Am I truly committed to survival, self-reliance, and
independence, or am I 
reluctant to accept the challenges of being
different?
•       
What am I going to do about the future of my family,
community, and nation 
as I face both limited and possibly global
catastrophic events?
--- Page 298 ---
282
We Are Survivalists
“He who fails to prepare for the night, fails to
prepare for the dawn.”
I am a survivalist, and by nature a survivalist is an
optimist. I do not have a pessimistic 
bone in my body. If what I just said sounds odd to
you, then you are not yet a survivalist 
and you do not understand the modern survivalist at
all. It is very difficult to communicate 
to the public the concept of an optimistic, hopeful
survivalist.


--- Page 384 ---
A fireman is a fireman, not because he believes
everything will burn, but because he 
believes much can be saved. Doctors don’t believe in
death—they believe in life. Similarly, 
a survivalist is not a survivalist because he
believes that everything will be destroyed and 
everyone will die, but because he believes that life
and freedom can be saved if people are 
prepared. A fireman does not start fires, a doctor
does not make diseases, and a survivalist 
does not make disaster. Crime, disease, war,
revolution, tyranny, fire, flood, famine, and 
economic upheavals are the results of Mother Nature
and the nature of man, and are not 
always within the power of anyone to prevent.
We all know that the sun will set each day, leaving
us in the darkness, and we all 
know that warm summers give way to cold winters. But
though we know we cannot stop 
the sun from setting or the cold winds from coming,
does this make us pessimistic? I 
think not! So then, why are survivalists called
pessimists when they make ready to face 
events that are just as much part of history and
nature as the sunset or the changing of 
the seasons.
Another misconception about survivalists is that they
are predicting world 
catastrophes. On the contrary, survivalists are the
optimistic minority who are predicting 
survival. It is difficult to find any respected
historian, economist, political scientist, 
sociologist, or military strategist who will predict
that disasters are not inevitable; yet we 
survivalists dare to be optimistic about the future.
We survivalists do not need to predict 
the probability of disaster any more than we need to
predict the sun setting. Those who 
criticize survivalists are like those persons who
refuse to look at the calendar, in the hope 


--- Page 385 ---
that through self-imposed ignorance they can keep
from aging another year. Denial will 
not stop the inevitable from coming.
Sometimes survivalists are told that, “You will be
disappointed if we don’t have a 
world cataclysm”; this is another accusation that is
totally ridiculous. We survivalists have 
loved ones that we do not want to see hurt or killed.
We have homes and property we do 
not want to see lost or destroyed. We are not so
foolish as to think that just because we are 
survivalists that disasters would not cause us to
experience danger, loss, hunger, injury, 
cold, despair, and death. We do not want bad things
to happen to good people; we want 
good people to be able to survive and stay free when
those things do happen.
As survivalists, we spend time and money to improve
our chances for survival and 
recovery in the event of a disaster, but we would
celebrate if we could be assured that we 
--- Page 299 ---
150 Survival Secrets  283
had wasted our time. Contrary to popular belief, we
survivalists will not be disappointed if 
there are no disasters to survive, any more than the
Red Cross is disappointed when there 
are no emergencies, or the man who buys fire
insurance is disappointed when his house 
fails to burn down. It may be said that the
survivalist would much prefer the pleasant, but 
unlikely, surprise of being wrong than the rude
awakening that the nonsurvivalist will 
face if he is wrong and thus unprepared.
Ultimately, the survivalist cannot lose because his
survival preparations will be of 
value regardless of what the future has in store. In
times of crisis, those who have not 


--- Page 386 ---
prepared to turn to each other are much more likely
to turn on each other. It is most 
regrettable indeed that many people still consider
survivalists as a threat and regard them 
with suspicion and even hostility. This attitude is
logically indefensible and is rooted in 
the non-survivalist’s own sense of fear and guilt.
Subconsciously, the non-survivalist may 
hate the survivalist for reminding him of how fragile
his lifestyle is.
So, let’s get the facts right. The most dangerous
people in today’s world are the non-
survivalists. Every person who has failed to make
provisions for surviving without food, 
water, fuel, and other essentials from the outside
world is potentially a mortal danger to 
his neighbors. What will a man do when he and his
family are cold, hungry, thirsty, and 
sick? He may ask his neighbors for help, but when
they have no extra fuel, food, water, 
or medication to give, will he just go back home to
die with his loved ones? What do you 
think he will do?
Survivalists who stock up on food and other supplies
do a great service to society 
because what we now buy is replaced on the shelves,
so there will be that much more 
available in times of crisis. When disaster strikes,
survivalists won’t be the ones looting 
and killing for food. We survivalists won’t be a
burden on the medical facilities or a 
danger to the police. We will be able to turn to each
other and we will not need to turn 
on anyone. We will be in a position to help our
neighbors and our community without 
endangering the safety and freedom of our families.
Survival preparedness should be 
regarded as a social obligation, one that every
responsible individual owes to his family, 
community and nation. The nonsurvivalist is a poor

and irresponsible citizen.
The reality is that survivalists are optimistic,
self-reliant individuals who cannot help 
but see the imperative of preparing for the worst
events, while at the same time working 
and hoping for a safer and freer future. Today’s
survivalist is an asset to the community 
and should be proud to say, “I am a survivalist.”
Author’s Note: A version of “We Are Survivalists” was
first published in Directions, a 
newsletter published by Live Free in the early 1980s.
It was written in response to the 
many misrepresentations and misconceptions then being
established by the news media. 
The article has been reprinted many times in
survival/self-reliance publications all over 
the world. This issue has been edited to reflect
modern concerns. It still serves as one of 
the best explanations of the philosophy and position
of true survivalism and of the Live 
Free organization that has been its oldest and
strongest advocate.

About the Author
James C. Jones was born on the South Side of Chicago
at the beginning of World War 
II. An impoverished and chaotic childhood made him a
natural survivalist from a very 
early age. He put together his own survival pack at
age twelve and often spent time in 
the woodlands and swamps that then adjoined the city.
Working two jobs while living 
in one room and attending high school added more
real-world survival experiences to 
his arsenal. Starting as a technician at a large
chemical manufacturing complex after 
school, his passion for safety lead him to become an

award-winning safety manager. 
While acquiring certifications in emergency medicine,
hazardous chemical handling, 
safety management, and training management related to
his job, he energetically pursued 
survival-related activities including rock climbing,
caving, rafting, horseback riding, and 
survival camping. He founded Live Free USA in the
late 1960s and helped it evolve 
from an outdoor survival club into a national
preparedness and self-reliance education 
organization. During the 1970s and 1980s, he was a
leading voice in defending and 
defining responsible survivalism on national
television and radio.
Mr. Jones has developed and conducted hundreds of
survival training events 
and seminars over the past forty years and has
written hundreds of articles for Live 
Free’s membership newsletter American Survivor. He is
now retired and living in 
Indiana, but currently writes articles for several
national preparedness- and survival-
related publications, while continuing to teach a
variety of survival courses and make 
presentations at major preparedness expositions. His
books include Total Survival and 
Advanced Survival. Both books are published by
Skyhorse Publishing. He may be
